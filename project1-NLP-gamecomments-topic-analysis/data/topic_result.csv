actually read interview ffs entire interview wa held gamepass number released executive wa asked comment ubisoft wa also preparing renting model pointed overall entertainment industry film music went way streaming based subscription model mentioned consumer clearly support model matter time follow suit hence infamous gamers get used owning quote nonsense redefining ownership also false close interview mentioning box blue ray cherishes totally understands preference permanent physical ownership say ubisoft remains committed providing traditional form purchase exclusive subscription model sale essentially choice important aspect b redefining sale ha nothing content interview quote constantly used shit ubisoft digital licensing wa made norm back ubisoft wa little tiny unremarkable developer valve actually pioneer digital licensing creation steam ship sailed decade ago long ubisoft ever sort influence overall industry trend taken quote literally basic objective observation

formula engine gameplay etc guess didnt read bad launch downhill come competition going tough imo im gon na need reason would want like ghost tsushima high bar point honestly doubt ubisoft even giving team ample chance surpass im calling asian brother sister supporter u forgotten asian men boycott time time marginalized ostracized ignored hollywood west stand u stand united otherwise voice never

cgi movie showing nothing gameplay dont know ubisoft pull kinda move yeah feel like missed boat deleted even year ago would pretty excited ghost tsushima coming pc day give absolutely fuck dont understand take dont playstation like samurai shogun itching great samurai japan cool anymore reveal launch anything thats free marketing ghost tsushima getnerate lot search regarding japan samurai thats ballsy last mirage went back stealthassassination path shorter even earliest installment wa never exactly thief hitman black man japan isnt exactly screaming social stealth though reality last gameplay chose first feel like person thought odyssey wa fantastic couldnt get wa never pure stealth series dont know keep thinking first wa set crusade fighting army knight stealth mechanic tbh lot criticism fucking ridiculous wa never stealth series im gon na need see something radically refreshing even consider wait year buy premium edition dlcs skin fraction price worth waiting anyway since ubisoft go price pretty quickly release dont watch gameplay make opinion way especialy pc arent objective release come ubisoft product even good hate boner make give opinion even full bad faith want honest review wait player actually played hour crazy viking pirate two group known stealth overly romanticized despite savage pillager got ninja original setting japan come im pretty sure obviousassassin yeah ninja feudal japan novelty idea draw least setting largely unexplored gaming communityfeudal japan cool overdone point im still surprised egypt greece skipped obvious roman italy make valhalla instead acting like japan original setting sekiro ghost anyway dont need trendy good none setting shit tho feudal japan original setting might used setting ww cool setting everything look amazing used lot fan want feudal japan ubisoft fan tsushima rise ronan got last week really enjoying tsushima solid way scratch itch well feel like lot setting wasted older though tech going mile better anything would gotten japan related back played recently couldnt help think much better would came studio previously made syndicate odyssey immortal fenyx rising make yet seen fair persian portion nizari ismaili state isnt really something see lot popular medium setting never get touched ancient mexico wouldnt trust company make featuring old gaelic civs every time approach aural violation accent valhalla dlc made want eat ear thats made popular middle east italy constantinople colonial america caribbean france china india russia victorian england ancient egypt greece expands get little bit everything telling larger story thats reason liked district wa wasnt set new york la dc would take colonial korea early c reddit moment ive never thought hindu mythology rpg would cool hell got ta shoehorn diversity cant asianinspired feature asian mc asian basically white anyway like right well ubisoft know gon na yasuke certain reason im dreading release finally decide make japanese setting even japanese character crazy western devs fight tooth nail asian male protagonist thank god sucker punch actually making ghost tsushima course theyre going use yasuke western medium using death despite retainer asian setting yup yasuke side character like us real world character whatever reason ubi doesnt see japanese diverse enough guess hatred towards asian men western entertainment continues unopposed guess dont get option asian man get buy ghost tsushima protest saw leak main character gon na yasuke konoichi honestly fucking move japanese setting male female protag japan trying put diversity sake diversity dumb overused plot trope man land japan becomes last samurai stupid ubisoft still doesnt believe japanese real like year ago found woman real fan complain instantly discarded racist watch role feudal era footnote despite odas retainer honestly fit proper supporting character im sure like still wa cool included samurai warrior obscure historical figure know next nothing end protagonist would feel like wa done wrong reason give ammunition racist also know japanese yasuke meet ubisoft going least bit surprised appearance reality must behaved said thing probably candid way would considered offensive today like trying wipe color supposedly choose two character yasuke female shinobi yea wa worst preorder ubisoft deserve stolen wife immediately preorder expensive version odyssey played favorite besides sims tom cruise ha entered chat shrug ubisoft moment heard knew would demographic american inner city completely go setting definitely feel like japanese theme park located america rather actual japan would love crazy nothing like tenchu generation probably going rd beyond ninja like hitman try go crazy attacking dont expect succeed yes ubisoft decided feature japanese male protagonist japan even option wont purchasing buying used buy support even didnt decision ha made stop sekiro sony pretty woke even understood set japan japanese main character bro imagine sony make ninja set japan doesnt lmao make black dude fuck thats oh yeah gun head real heavy wish wa way could serious question piss japanese market make africasubsahara youre taking slave trade hunting exotic animal learning various african tribe kingdom got doesnt everything love played trial latest recently uninstalled h wanted enjoy even story couldnt cause character cringy uninteresting thats pretty funny code name twinkie yellow outside white inside probably still arpg since made ubi lot money made devs developed odyssey might take lot better worse hope three favourite meant something least somewhat different stuff starting codename red wa meant new era theyve really said mean origin itll worth know going different older ghost tsushima ezio new trilogy set feudal japan likeable ninja protagonist would awesome bot upvote comment created name company im pretty sure must reasonable explanation nobody reasonable excited another skull bone well mirage sucked heavily valhalla previous mainline year ago ww present day last remaining break glass incase emergency modern day idea died desmond maybe want keep open new basim stuff thats many long year ago ubioft changed appealing fan ip common folk sadly ole industry following bigger number really low standard pretty much everything questionable taste make really easy make money since trow pretty much anything abuse folk also refuse understand selling well good quality agressively defend greedy company abusing thats dark age gaming industry sad mirage didnt get enough attention theyre likely going go back rpg stuff made linear developed better storyline series mightve future would rather mirage completion time rpg oh well valhalla made billion thats popular sell million copy also hope ubisoft break glass clean safely hinted first crazy taken long unfortunate part ghost tsushima exists gon na compared lot still another rpg kinda hit miss guess trailer gon na cinematic trailer setting character probably wont learn lot considering wa lore found straight said theyd never japan definitely break glass entry lmao broke glass tad late ghost tsushima already exists asked ghost tsushima came gon na shittier version late better like ghost thusima rise ronin literally since first came ghost tsushima came feel itch ha scratched got better current would feel missed chance late wont even half good ghost tsushima assasins literally copying sonys title point valhalla dawn ragnarok copied god war english often see fire protection extinguishment equipment emergency equipment behind glass labelled break glass case emergency break glass american english refers something used emergency last resort ubisoft getting desperate referencing break glass case emergency real life normally fire alarm something like although dont see much glass anymore least live meaning ubisoft crisis mode entry last resort last hope kind thing probably refer emergency box tool needed emergency situation like hammer key keep glass box sign break glass case emergency full expression break glass case emergency seen written glass case house emergency fire extinguisher case emergency little hammer attached side case connected metal chain use break glass mean emergency action desperate solution assasins set japan would sell well according ubisoft ii assume know still gon na flop average sale number meeting expectation term break glass case emergency used fire extinguisher applied way saying ubisoft making last resort kind measure come case emergency break glass fire alarm example class cover writing google quote youll see version theme english isnt native language yet use eloquently nice job im pretty sure said wouldnt could justice right clearly technical capability first nextgen actually pull break glass matter ppl try say valhalla wa commercially successful mirage also performed beyond expectation commercially critically commercially successful since origin pretty sure mirage flopped mentioning valhalla mirage prof attract crowd hasnt touched long time hate fall category next month ubisoft forward event gameplay trailer released june pretty soon maybe im minority im hoping mystical power similar odyssey work well ninja theme way would feel like proper fantasy rpg valhalla went grounded ability scaled back loot system never felt like op god matter much levelled odyssey still favourite rpg ive played dont know im minority give origin jaoan id incredibly happy engine previous always show new mechanic big story plot valhalla hidden blade top syndicate showed grapple hook carriage origin showed bow shield unity showed phantom blade could go nothing gameplay false understand mean love cgi trailer digic picture amazing understand cinematic trailer unmatched mask shitty gameplay ghost tsushima better opinion ship ha sailed high think title wont massive number valhalla already successful title ever made making billion dollar surpass number forget small reddit compared casual gaming population would still fuck odyssey style something like cult tree sort shadowy conspiracy vibe wa missing valhalla experience ubisoft life past together bethesda deleted big ole also timing fortunate considering streaming success fx series shogun dont give fuck isnt coming revealed next week soonest coming fall time done got excited feudal japan themed common enough giving enough fuck despite reddit antiubisoft circlejerk even mediocre side already got ghost year ago im excited sekiro itching great samurai thats caveat cant remember last great would cool heyday acblack flag era like dragon ishin guy get im really making claim mean seems interesting mean sony kinda fumble launch pretty clever get attention target audience mirage combat enjoyable badcould worked somewhat didnt stamen bar bruh odyssey x better hope samurai good although keep thinking ninja instead samurai wouldnt surprise samurai main version side ninja japan problem wa felt even worse came prior got day refunded within minute fuck paying even playing something wa obviously rushed door despite clearly trying something fan actually asked butchering beyond expectation yes mirage considered mainline bit spinoff maybe shinobi use social stealth majority weve played stick rooftop bush anyway japanese pirate ninjason boat steam dont even wait long ubisoft bought valhalla launch standard version buddy bought ubisoft store month later discount seasonexpansion pas included paid much le bigger edition month launched odyssey launched valhalla waited month got bigger edition way cheaper standard edition launched ubisoft ha always go price real quick think latest farcry wa fastest though recall going month fair wa also absolute masterpiece shit honest user review arent worth much period regardless company understand objectivity nuance user review lay good bad id definitely consider said dont lot listen whatever streamer youtuber tell give review accordingly deleted def arent good tip ill try see stream well biggest thing get many review possible see common takeaway pretty easy filter shitty review find useful information make almost purchasing decision hasnt failed yet dont like seeing detailed gameplay ruin experience prefer going blind yea wa good pirate though exactly stealth immediately think japanese ninja tenchu type never really thought make good point get viking prirates ninja origin wa incredible setting would never thought could work also feel like much well thought odyssey felt somewhat mmo ish grindy worst writingvoice actingmost repetitive mission series honestly dont understand havent done mainline entry set spain portugal bewildering missed opportunity would fit vibe way better samurai pirate american revolution greek mythology viking fair viking werent much savage raider culture europe come roman fending allying cooping germanic raider century fall western empire viking pretty much big reason linger cultural memory englishspeaking english slow adapt prime raiding target longer rest europe scholar whose source draw monk priest newly christianized land didnt take well still pagan viking considering church gold offlimits also england unified kingdom le result almost soap opera like series viking conquest anglosaxon reversal said conquest conquest viking conquest french descendant viking another reason big fierce warrior dude cant believe went blend crowd mechanic towhatever become ninja didnt actually exist way think though ninja shinobi essentially espionage trained samurai didnt want different asian country theyd research feudal china would way cooler lot le done modern medium go asian country aside japan give example overdone apart two ghost thushisma total war shogun tv show thought wa going crazy way story wa setup wa basically international organization existing place wouldnt expect influencing world japan little dull done million time yeah day ill get mainline prebritish colonisation set india guess ill need wait logner tenchu sekiro best feeling control ever go show much pay attention lol wa depends theyre handling story framework reason didnt get japan long wa syndicate wa desmonds bloodline originsodyssey wa going back origin order hidden blade wa already century old origin valhalla stuck assassiny stuff dont know theyre going tie stuff japan storyline challenge setting precolumbian mesoamerica hard asssassin contact old world european colonisation like said see japan tie theyre still using portaanimus framework thing also keep mind even wa set early spanish conquest period fair chunk mesoamerica already fallen like youd get aztec around already postapocalyptic society time spanish turned number mayan city abandoned teorihuacano civilisation already collapsed edit also wa got revealed back wa set contactperiod mesoamerica devs get weird making possible either aztec spaniard ooooo yes let precolumbian america general would interesting fresh apocalypto adaptation hell yeah thats good point lol someone could nail language voice would fabulous though proving ignorance come lol half pretty well covered medium though ton stuff set egypt greece russia china pretty much era england colonial america maybe video exist heh neat though didnt realize covered much ground know jack shit korea way shape form let really want boxer rebellion rdr would perfect ill take ive dying indian fucking suck removed pc version probably last samurai plural refers class whole japanese doesnt utilize plurality way english doe source 日本語を話す last samurai movie isnt tom cruise though based real life story though guy wa french american nobunaga forced bathe try scrub black didnt believe black like fuck ubi portraying little legend still make little comfort case also issue asian male representation well continued issue female asian lead sidelined nonasian male protagonist western medium buy book least season pas content whatever call normally worth extra content past could sold separate still worth sad hogwarts legacy noices term feel like older gameplay newer better happy using valhalla combat system variation valhalla satisfying combat odyssey favourite franchise none others ive played even come close hope closer thanks exactly feel mean time still passable unfortunately crazy get repeat formula since nearly every year rake money regardless lol honestly contrary many absolutely adored time valhalla music character adorable sometimes heartwrenching sidestories brutal combat amazing sure feel quite large like honestly wa still excellent product even didnt feel like series expect certain thing ubisoft hand right lean big openworld dense city parkouropportunities foundation wa valhalla proof lie mirage dont think execute samuraininja without least type parkour mechanic hope ubisoft doesnt lean expanding even even wont interested always prefer smaller dense valhalla case massive size map whole package worked really sold immersion early viking england climbing tower synchronising local area identify piece glass collect different method icon mean clean brush hand mean picking large chunk vaguely recall saying time japaneseninja setting wa obvious thing wa exactly didnt want time change guess almost theyve strung u along make money whole time day roommate asked wa playing ghost tsushima told like samurai depends stealth tbh got stealth wa op kinda boring awhile swordplay style amazing rise ronin wonderful bought solely reminded got expected disappointed knew wasnt going like got fairness never wanted great dont think ive seen detailed character creator quite time outfit fun world lovely well like story character ive never seen pick adventure style done quite like know mid review wa quite pleased valhalla copy god war ha craziest comparison ive heard awhile already two similarly valhalla thing could claim lifted gow settinguse norse mythology however saying would imply gow invented thing didnt actually id argue copied lot lord ringsthe hobbit look dwarf architecture instance reason elf ancient speciescivilisation predate everyone else cause based norse paganism ghost tsushima rise ronin air assassination double assassination roof top assassination gameplay based defense counter attack lost way long ago japan wa always emergency button late ship ha sailed miss black flag shanty connect dot mean idea ubisoft ha keeping developing even though everyone knew like would successful broke emergency glass starting make guess arent well confused breaking glass ceiling thats kind sad way predatory moneygrubbing tactic moneygrubbing hoped last resort make actually good thats almost certainly incorrect aaagames nowadays typically take year development wa announced codename red mustve development least year back also already announced hub multipleall world codename infinity mobile codename jade online multiplayer codename invictus gameplaysuccessor mirage codename hexe like explain current trend planned year advance last main billion revenue probably going flop im come sale whatever community somewhat divided itll hard impossible meet everyones expectation would want old like brotherhood say origin odyssey arent proper outright hate modern day stuff others praise origin odyssey modern take attempt breathe fresh air franchise combat system love odyssey best installment franchise reason ive also loved parcour system unity unity imho best parcour system series retrospect dont like combat mechanic earlier installment although im since beginning havent played mirage basically loki guy killed leilawhile loki reason mad odin leila applaud ubisoft bald move still dont like basim loki im pretty sure said wouldnt could justice right nah thats painting nice picture creative director alex hutchinson told oxm internet suggest boring setting three wanted wwii feudal japan egypt theyre kind three worst setting ironically ubisoft eventually make set egypt speaking total xbox ahead french revolutionset unity hutchinson said feudal japan would work sure feel like would start look like oh played know meanoh ive ninja ive samurai edit ubisoft fanboys misunderstanding meant thinking want setting saying weve asking age theyve gone nah thats stupid le popular stop glazing megacorps maybe kinda flopped west wa big hit mena country though definitly didnt flop spinoff title main popular like said ubisoft wa happy yah mirage wa dreadful deleted think get trailer xbox showcase deep dive ubisoft forward sw outlaw last year nope newgen expect way improved mechanic visuals even showed wrist gun best cinematic trailer ever ghost pretty awesome city setting filled friend foe unlike ghost ghost wa either safe zone mongrel base aragami well sprawling city though assassination combat sneak style sure outside stealth got two completely different many thing doe got failed wa parkor wa social stealth wa hidden blade assassination wa templar v like narrative wa npc historical figure wa larger urban area least ubisoft dont delist selling country im pumped pc soon ghost good doesnt even come close matching sheer freedom traversal im looking forward doubt traversal make exploring huge open world fun entire thread deluded think going massive success despite reddits infinite wisdom selling copy ever red lag name alone better skull bone picked tf quite bit release still time time matchmaking much alive pair relative skill level doesnt really need online community rarely drive deleted man everyone really forgot rise ronin rose colored glass probably saying origin oddyssey among highest rated even valhalla ahead revelation even going metacritic sale also strong latest release took get mirage love wa mainly fight mechanic mention really fun matter couldnt get used even end finished obtained trophy never felt like flowed smoothly thought combat wa purposefully unintuitive main character isnt master bit noob seconding combat doesnt matter much steal youre lot combat youre playing wrong stealth focused though right combat shouldnt matter much surely mirage combat suck shoehorned rpgstyle gameplay engine stealthbased onehitkill style showed wa hackjob hate lot review make joke fun probably point many really dont care wish know good without discussing surrounding drama cite question entire answer bad fucked took part focus pirate part edit know black flag great im talking took part skull bone perhaps predictable setting already doneis didnt want make long kassandras voice nice shes fun odyssey really cool imo absolutely gorgeous really feel like odyssey way travel much superhuman feat id love go spain someday plenty nice big cathedral climb lovely terrain lot great period history set believe used spain movie seemed like waste considering account bad film thats literally two way saying thing tbh 忍者 read ninja onyomi read shinobi kunyomi wasnt title given specific mission could ninja mission stealthy shit back regular infantry samurai guy big battle could wrong though vietnam war setting would cool stealth idk would like cuz whole killing westerner boxer rebellion want interwar central asia absolutely never happen samarkand tashkent bokhara kashgar etc time russian revolution ha caused chaos across continent interesting time get spy everywhere british officer like frederick bailey joining cheka disguise given mission hunting definitely space protagonist two also seems like opportunity highlight culture arent often portrayed western medium explore awful mess wa russian colonial expansion central asia top head rise ronin ryu ga gotoku ishin sekiro samurai warrior nioh tactic way samurai tenchu onimusha shinobi admittedly played mirage since played really long time ago mirage although wish spent time end bagdad first real existed video character first altaïr wa nizari citizen syrian part state th century far simple order nation whats still exist today nizari ismaili today third biggest branch islam sunni twelver shia modern leader far call al mualim powerful men world dont know longer kill make impact world theyre rich fuck well organised extremely well integrated everywhere exist world doesnt mean powerless however amongst thing founded nation pakistan mean already take lot creative liberty come telling history story wouldnt outta realm possibility make traverse different period mesoamerican rule concluding spanish templar trying find piece eden native something think ton pissed read china india russia sidescroller spinoffs though mobile going back china thats coming soon couple year think codename jade revealed time codename red japan codename hexe supposedly th century central europe holy roman empire similar kingdom come deliverance always bounce around think recent wa pakistan idea main story affect human history adam eve mentioned well know cant help deleted yeah im hater either loved odyssey origin valhalla although valhalla never beat bloated narrative suffers im simply guy like action rpgs loot level ups pretty graphic odyssey remains favorite last several entry big part kassandra writing dialogue awesome va killed va eivor great job performance writing didnt capture thoroughly kassandra still loved time valhalla liked valhalla think wa hurt rather benefited executive probably wouldnt liked went completely ip something new think highly likely lean thing think good without actually creative thinking make great suspect going significant amount bloat liked valhalla biggest problem wa length wanted finish felt wa exactly like odyssey origin bad thing much enjoyed agree audiovisual aspect excellent repetetive gameplay felt like job also remember character storyline wich felt worthy rememberingbut fudge talking valhalla wa ten ten hour literally thing unlike didnt switch literally mission mechanic hour completion wa dogshit big empty feeling useless world got ta agree everything world wa beautiful would explore stumble weird activity side quest taking sight also loved valhalla dozen u holy shit expect good parkour press button run straight line expect precise combat whatever hell vallhala wa lastly wish hour finish main quest line thx favorite part valhalla wa guy asks okay cry dead friend say yes cry funeral pyre forever know finished hid bush went go get high came back week passed daynight cycle daynight cycle dude wa sitting sobbing eye like damn man really let mirage best made bet worked ubi said didnt expect would sell well story wa kinda mid forgettable liked organic way wa done subplotlines distributed amongst differents bureau mission converging head order made feel like really part organisation cog machine happened find clue leading ending man army protagonist running around leaving trail blood errand tell go kill final guy wonder waited gameplay wa super smooth parkour wa unitylevel think second best parkour series impressive built top valhalla parkour combat felt great hard kill fast die fast easily youre good clutch escape fighting group ennemies cant go level trying fight everyone ambiance wa really really incredible already captured great feel valhalla flaw wa immersive menu felt great wa really refined mirage sometimes open menu stop menu music color interface little stylised symbol good immersive visually baghdad beautiful environment ive personally ever seen color sound detail feel like real city animation voice acting also resulted really cool character let forget voice shohreh aghdashloo basim wa really cool character maybe ezio tier close mile ahead say connor edward feel super underexploited get wa supposed dlc got carried away became could really bit ambitious narrative length wa also good think especially burning trying finish oversized valhalla could hour longer im glad wa h size map felt perfect way big enough dense enough never feel like youve seen doe take half hour go point point b anyway really incredible long time hope take example mirage deleted really wanted get valhalla loved intro fell really hard hearing someone describe combat brutalamazing wild haha appreciate response genuinely dont understand hate ubi get tend polished usually get quite bit mileage im interested hear dont like understand gripe valhalla good great battle lot room explore story wa interesting well plan series changed last year think likely explanation didnt think could keep formula liked set japan change could disastrous also pretty clear itd really damn important get japan right since seems like obvious thing world getting wrong would probably doom series would require thinking beyond next quarterly earnings report thats stay honor yell whenever go enemy base fight head im currently playing valhalla like alot launch tbh stealth awful id rather op stealth work whatever think balance really damn good storytelling perspective actually higher difficulty straightup swordfights really bloody difficult enemy mobbing make really hard ever anything safely hand using ghost weapon stealth dishonourable option let take far enemy far fewer issue jin afford single fight go way part make sense hed end embracing method ghost hard doe order protect ahhh yes mythology ha existed thousand year ha covered countless piece medium definitely copied specific recent guess gone full circle reference deleted throwing stone glass house well would probably still moneygrubbing hopefully impress story mechanic time even criticicized requested many year lol stop valhalla made billion dollar love shittalking ubisoft much next ubi hater feel ignorant edit fair insert letterkenny gif guess dont know recent done wa thinking series since wa topic valhalla ha biggest earner ever yall delusional think ubisoft deep doesnt even good samurai going sell regardless afraid doubt plan make good amount quality theyve pumping setting going heavy lifting native english speaker dont know ive actually heard term used like wasnt quite sure meant either lol thank asking know break glass case emergency course ive dont recall ever hearing someone say anything like op said additional explanation done deterrent keep safety equipment used vandalized needed putting behind act vandalism discourages playing equipment least make obvious tampered cant put glass back theyve done ancient greece egypt viking period would say certainly mainstream historical period im sure japan break glass tbh literally every single setting based popular historical setting quote exists somewhere wa terribly explained lmao renaissance italy wa center world time could possibly consider obscure historical period totally get mean phrase mainstream historical period funny still life see world war fucking two bad setting hitler occult arm hunt first civ artifactsnumerous chaotic situation use really ham lorehello mcfly yeah make egypt turned really good dont see issue asking year finally decide still receive criticism like havent even seen yet lol excuse never even heard cant true keep hearing overhauled everything moving next gen including parkour thats reason im remotely interested god hope better combat system theyve used past work latest version anvil course system updated come limitation anvil always still good engine im saying new dont using dude block bullet connor taking entire army giving fuck oh man remember every bit trailer rewatched time least think revelation best trailer followed closely trailer lol mongrel base goddamn mongrelians think stopped great city since syndicate paris unity london syndicate last attempted big sprawling city wa like sekiro lite dont bother arguing lol guess didnt single say thats reddit bro consistently bestselling franchise valhalla wa number release year believe going reddit would think last leg massive success thousand work year plus usual gigantic marketing campaign modern incredibly expensive create le massive success would loss ubisoft thing wa thing could remember correctly played black flag odyssey example odyssey stealthy want attack group enemy actually fight got different move unlock even escaping isnt hard get inovative wanted poster around town also annoying af every time close poster mofo trying look course see scream guard whatnot overall wa worth money paid got discount lel still great regardless sb isnt though see dont know came yes focus wa pirate part pretty much doesnt mean brotherhood thats whole point series title find black flag literal definition least black flag still covered background storyline also much series ha tied specific bloodline europe leading even nonwhite main character biracial story early part ie origin odyssey tied mediterranean origin order hidden blade really point valhalla could fuck japan stick something new machine read dna since didnt need relative anymore mirage doesnt count since wa originally valhalla dlc theory big japan good launch new era theyve talking thats meant big change series already bunch ninja theyll compared preestablished title ninja genre afraid theyll bungle damage brand put shoddy ninja kassandra wa standout sure youre right journo part wa autocorrect dont even know happened rest true best last year maybe made japanese studio fromsoftware capcom nintendo team ninja etc cant deny fact zelda great go soul go nioh ninja gaiden japanese make best car tool electronics overall im odyssey part know humour valhalla might good half arc main story optional im backwards get never played valhalla loved viking figured ignorantly didnt realise tied wa fun real fun yes absolutely adore odyssey easily favourite wa playing away cephalonia really enjoying everything could catching boat saw map mind wa blown sorry hardcore fan absolutely love kassandra wa fun wa world ha felt alive like odyssey wa well cluttered infested npc npc didnt stand around wander seemed role job purpose ran past interaction least quest yes voicework kassandra wa fantastic greatest vocaps weve ever stumbled upon ancient ruin previous empire wa astounding realize ancient world wa around remains even ancient wa probably vibrant huge alive yet wa entirely completely gone realize wa gone dont know maybe kind brought thew reality history front center played ancient history wa kind thing head made real ancient history wa four time longer modern history society still infancy comparison thousand year everything around u right nothing bit rubble ruin fringe whatever civilization come u nothing immersion breaking pant suit kassandra im kassandra became favorite protagonist least tied ezio edward wish ubisoft continued expand character feel deserved sequel series like ezio wa flawed incredibly charismatic great character feel like alexios wa also awesome character similar ka different shame character choice didnt get much recognition id rather combat man anyway brilliant either character go kind classic foil writing dialogue awesome base absolutely forced romance ending legacy first blade dlc wa fucking atrocious odyssey great even got dlc hour hour odyssey hooked time thought gaming wa dead odyssey league save valhalla music odyssey wa also absolutely incredible guess odyssey wa fine burned hour trying clean map kinda miserable finding chest complete area also bunch worthless loot seemed pointless kept needing scrap dont remember anything particularly good bad annoyance primarily map cleaning typically isnt cup tea ive never played kassandra alexios try playthrough sometime time opinion odyssey wa big city huge open world right valhalla didnt well comparison athens korinth argo thebe piraeus elis sparta felt lot substantial valhalla maybe wa architecture honestly ive felt since stand fact ghost tsushima best ive ever played franchise suffering theyre trying tie animus real world without actually anything interesting say real world would much better served making compelling historical fiction ditching animus present altogether still remember desmond character arc could tell anything woman real world valhalla honestly desperately want ditch assassinstemplars conflict well fucking write historical fiction without crutch stuff ha worst content recent valhalla odyssey compelling moment historical fiction characterization subplots yeah main story took like hr finish dont see make complete region order beat lot area felt like side story relevant plot felt like watching tvshow saga felt like selfcontained season tvshow also try tell overarching plot like criminal mind usually ha larger plot top episodespecific plot dont know whether make sense best analogy come put week come back really forget much story contained actually kind cool big haha couldnt possibly wrong valhalla awesome ha varied quest mission design gamers different like different thing hate come repetitive formula far cry share similar gameplay loop even mechanic even within title lot repetition originally ezio title origin though valhalla fraction playerbase still hasnt forgiven ubi switching away ezio style open world style ubisoft ha talented music director art director programmer find gameplay designer narrative director know innovate similar story similar gameplay system mainly hate come honestly fair top ubisofts corporate side doe understand pr work absolutely moronic comment seem appear every two week like comment owning entire nft quartz fiasco whole sexual harassment lawsuit yves guillemot outoftouch exec etc extremely repetitive boring world design boring task always formula went story driven repeating task open world specifically completely abandoned identity also arent polished valhalla fe still ha problem instability combine accessory extra buyable via real money grinding like mmo single player ubisofts shitty practice consumer loved series far cry back day tried valhalla played hour gave feel like work isnt fun company getting away using marveltm character modern day copying anything surely witcher since thats theyve chasing since origin japanese mythology general lends extremely well japan basically origin archetype build fantasy japanese myth also ha ton unique interesting deity modern entry love integrate winter day decided finally try south park sequel picked steam couldnt single player without setting ubisoft account wa like know ubisoft scum im letting life anymore fuck suck pay remind hated ill never forget lol wait question always valhalla well would done hadnt released november impossible answer suppose speculate probably still pretty well billion dollar well eh im probably remember old interview far bigger beast today probably different helm wa brotherhood released agree feel like break glass moment way ive always described youre ninja x historical location get thats basically wa always ninja colonial americathe carribean ninja danelaw england ninja ancient egypt wa interesting contrast ninja japan iskindabland done million time wouldnt make really good map run around theyve always excelled capturing time veryinteresting location pick crusade era syria would presume mean represented video think lot industry stuck idea ww setting done wa prevalent around year ago got glut big name set ww even though aaa space ww common day redditors wan na nerd rage ubisoft yeah thats expect improved engine newer hardware definitely fidelity world charscters especially considering nice world looked already god damn fungus kang mongrel army good boy almost confused mutt house first time seeing athens odyssey wa delight tbf last set way urban city really thing dont know love alexandria origin baghdad wa fucking great share common inspiration tenchu though aragami much like tenchu sekiro odyssey wa record profit holder even went contender several goty award hasnt happened since maybe franchise alive kicking selling like hotcake black flag great ive heard skull bone yeah ubisoft ported lot mechanic ship combat black flag wa talking skull bone basically black flag ship combat without part bombed could linked main series way chronicle skyrim fallout witcher mass effect portal minecraft red dead undertale god war doom civilization series counterstrike overwatch fortnite dishonored hollow knight alan wake sims dota titanfall league legend borderland pubg world warcraft crash bandicoot psychonauts ghost tsushima sly cooper baldurs gate spiderman tony hawk pro skater hitman cuphead uncharted last u ratchet clank shovel knight far cry gear war bioshock motherfucking tetri plus million look man weeb want like japanese stuff pretend like japan beall endall electronics disingenuous deluded saw map mind wa blown sorry hardcore fan absolutely love kassandra wa fun brother came home highschool new spent weekend playing first together ive played every since dont sorry odyssey hand favorite black flag close second maybe like boat tho cu wa dislike valhalla ive played different think odyssey probably favorite wa definitely repetitive insanely long wa getting tired end wa pleasing look fun explore story main side quest also interesting someone really didnt like original love giant open world rpgs basically tailor made also feel bad og fan thats like still favorite black flag exploration dont mind linear feeling feel dated valhalla came promo cpu bought figured id try loved decided check odyssey since wa sale wa even better feel like everyone bitch ubisoft present enjoys retrospect saw map mind wa blown sorry hardcore fan absolutely love kassandra wa fun ive playing since came im legit convinced complainer either never went back replay old rosetinted goggles help forget tediously dull first wa much desmond animus bullshit dragged otherwise fantastic historical going back replay chore every mission youre pulled animus forced trudge around walkingsimulator section boring environment imaginable allowed resume core story unfolding past stumbled upon ancient ruin previous empire wa astounding realize ancient world wa around remains even ancient wa probably vibrant huge alive yet wa entirely completely gone ohhhh ok amazing wa odyssey origin wa really humbling small aspect made feel exploring ancient civilization around u ruin even ancient civilization old egypt wa u running around ruin half old ruin twice old referring modern day kassandra valhalla fucking hated even clothes really passing torch like laila weve like real investment reason care part wa fine interesting twist fact died immediately afterwards chosen bullshit spoiled couldnt finish otherwise odyssey would favorite long shot wouldve liked honestly really gave three worth content dlc continued come like year really wa fantastic saga second would awesome maybe set byzantium actually prefer bayak honest shes good dont get wrong like sarcasm id put par female shepard mass effect agreed favorite part odyssey playing alexios barely remember kassandras story theyd ditch weird animus shit give x area world time sect belong cool old clan thing occasionally little piece gear story touch focused x land time theyd recipe success instead take recipe start well dont like beef house substituted tofu dont use egg used vegan egg substitute also dont like ginger used garlic anyways meal sucked million time word youre looking serial couldnt finish mirage repetition attacking prison time different objective wa done thank many culture cutthroathitmenspies first originally based real life order middle eastern origin ninjaarchetype merely japan take type shady character albeit ha become highly romanticized curious seeing acjapan like hard speculate know lot excited setting talk want dont think good long time industry prof time time taste meaningless come salesmoney made since wouldnt thirty foot pole someone else holding make bank wa said japan wa familiar setting also said internet suggest boring setting gamers kept asking japan egypt sorta get whole thing find time period without ninja inject fictional ninja hard achieve feeling anachronistic confluence setting ha actual historical ninja also think set japan massive fan expectation wont able live ubisoft know mhm le recall talking swear wa back came said lol ha highly requested time period clearly interest youre right basically ninja setting fit better story literal feudal japan death samaritan athens wa wonderfully designed absolutely hated fact basically fast travel point rarely located well enough quick movement end running street building spaced fun run across either yeah another level traverse without much care older big city end would knew part make part different wouldnt way different place athens wa pretty thats seeing wa delight sure traversal much sorry compare paris london athens athene barely felt like city designed parkouring never really looked heard couldnt even get boat lol dont know thats true rdr witcher baldurs gate come close zelda fromsoftwares goyslop shouldnt even mentioned go skyrim pubg sims

good job bringing style modern era yep bad studio doesnt want anymore lbp anymore street fighter ii cod modern warfare every wow list appears focused single player experience may feature multiplayer strong single player maybe thats wow agree genre defining ha huge player base lot could considered goat genre way list blizzard alone diablo starcraft around mark despite beng arguably culturally influential release genre rts general hugely snubbed aoe like warcraft even list insane considering impact whole gaming landscape get custom hard include kind list doe starcraft make list like wc genre havent relevant last year even influential title thought much later especially since looking list last year san andreas probably best gta time deserves higher feel gtav good benefit recency bias also world warcraft defined genre almost year always seems get shafted list like typical live long enough become villain type thing think extremely good track record also enough time make huge load mistake obviously shift perspective thata wow isnt lifestyle gta high general seems really weird gta gta san andreas seem cultural standouts sure make gta worthy listed high many ranking first thought obviously im biased fact every genre last decade ha goal wow killer failed really say something series differential wa shocked see big difference fo fonv think flipped relative spot would really bat eye fo wa better received release nv ha aged lot better eye fan fucking universe earning spot getting shafted daft take youre misinterpreting data list like take average feel usually recent feeling shortly come stuff like wow defining genre yearstrue wouldnt included number number reflect fact lot simply dont enjoy genre polled million gamers today asked select list extremely influential wow wa list im sure would rank high basically im saying youre right list also right like definition right since simply averaging rating cant however tell thing youre talking aboutinfluence man big ups warcraft comment fr true still standard pretty much csgo isnt even list starcraft ii isnt top interesting iconic ever made completely absent bias pretty clear competitive rtsfps reviewer focus fact wow isnt top every list laughable wa cultural phenomenon still good year later still dominates entire genre opinion single greatest ever made timeless fundamental issue list like mean fault op since aggregated list seem mix concept best influential throw list list best tetri doesnt deserve anywhere near top like currently tetri enjoyable way pas time hard argue better list wa influential list absolutely deserves influential list gta said doesnt belong high effectively derivative gta addition cover shooter weapon wheel mechanic first perhaps could argue multiplayer influenced decade horrible microtransactions live service think usually list look positive influence fact gtav even top need know quality ranking system gta always big deal gta changed video pregtav san andreas wa nearly universally considered best franchise guess interesting whats personal top couple hour made realise played many long time didnt include played minute maybe played everything top except last u played minute recent bias action certainly product review still traditional medium magazine time going back metacritic review played year ago warcraft spawned entire genre mobas wake underpinned successful mmo time super popular revolutionary right feature take granted today like automatic match making ranked modding community etc took giant leap forward title easily top top influential title time played multiple hundred life warcraft still objectively fucking good campaign sound design music atmosphere story competitive potential responsiveness character design innovativity relative time custom replayability legacy left well hold today im sorry top list doesnt include cant take list seriously fucking universe better war league legend dota list spawned warcraft spirit w life guess wa top rated deleted never understand hype around universe wa great unique inovative gameplay much terrarium titanfall sekiro didnt make either outer wild share dna excellent ive never seen guild war

played first time college wa blowing strategy guide played version first time last year favourite time alien continue make progress avatar project going slow well need move fast im also happy picked right civilization civilization iv ha heart sort actually blame short little alien long neck little fucker almost caused gaming exist backlash im aware wasnt contributor place power got ta deserved think didnt even factor expansion many consider even better main probably fallout mostly worked launch easier review higher fallout new vega wa disaster launch everyone say nv better dont doubt could never get much tried twice year apart didnt get far fallout hand played much largely contributed two red ringed xboxes also played within last year got way dlcs got achievement new vega grew popularity time pretty much everyone knew didnt like much came including couple year later picked tried fell love favorite ever think fallout bethesda immediately addicting awesome super fun world new vega take time get think much rewarding agree placement also agree would thought would way round considering comment many forum fallout wa honestly much memorable experience remember possible companion fo several notable npc memorable thing remember fonv wa start ranger base spoke three npc using voice actor within two minute ending got love new vega wa obsidian returning franchise fix bethesdas shortcoming fell flat perfect dark wa better goldeneye area yet goldeneye top p perfect dark isnt listed perfect dark added ability bot thought wa huge time like agree nv far superior difficult see many rank higher bug lack polish nv made much harder enjoy yeah wa still bethesda wart least function even day reinstall nv sometimes bunch stability mod still crash every second time fallout wa insane fallout nv came late console lifespan wa seen dlc wa buggy mess launch layman wasnt wow enough fallout also didnt marketing hype around said nv way better without doubt mind sold way way wa flagship title new generation console nv basically great expansion better sure wa built heavily fo pale comparison new vega may better still fundamentally derivative sequel fallout meant wa never position disruptive industry fo harder appreciate open world actionrpgs ubiquitous success traditional crpg like baldurs gate iii considered newsworthy wa time shift traditional rpg combat poorly defined action combat wa deeply controversial come timing weirdass vat system tricking rpg player playing fps physicsbased gore vanity cam tricking dudebros playing rpg fallout arguably responsible industry shifting towards arpgs away traditional rpgs thought wa way better agree seems unpopular opinion day reason ha emotional cohesive story new vega ha really strong opening seems like main story quickly unravels bunch side quest deleted joke wa could watch saturday morning cartoon time took go door new vega joke didnt exaggerate much perception improve exponentially

nostalgia hindsight youd wait like year arguably better youd really argue havent played sekiro yet elden ring fuckin slap seriously incredible yeah elden ring universal top another decade top minmaxers sometimes think exploit exists must use complain trivialized existence chose use ironically sound like experience breath wild found total bore dont think outer wild big reveal certainly ha series smaller discovery way anyway say le said better discovery pretty much main selling point far bad probably doesnt help hyped beyond belief yes collector arent ranking collection based best time influential maybe best entirely different metric best car time list aging removed equation would dominated modern car infinitely better safety faster speed better suspension softer seat etc etc video arent quite bad car graphic gameplay feature age extremely poorly every generation give much better graphic every aiming top tier graphical fidelity going look bad hindsight gameplay popular also get ripped refined wa revolutionary gameplay becomes modern day cliche gameplay impossible separate thing talking best person ha metric determining much gameplay graphic aging affect might matter felt first released others might matter well hold first played today basically cant dismiss aging talking quality intrinsically tied still around plus modern arcade barely like gambling machine aimed child

unbiased reviewer always give concrete example actual gameplay doesnt like something imo literally nail review almost every time everyone else wa either glazing kicking shit star war outlaw review wa saw ended accurate take shoehorned playable yasuke sake instead appearing interesting npc probably appear progressive cool sound like would worked perfectly fine character naoe mmm read somewhere wa departure rpg style enemy look quite spongy low kick ground opponent sends flying instead look kinda goofy ive seen goofy physic many tho meh hate ubisoft tbh hope fan get hoping doe look better last played wont bite though dont care know anything controversy ha tough competition mh wild around corner beast consume free time impossible would spend full price knowing couple month free gamepass something post getting downvoted th reskinned origin making warrior long cant see main character biggest gripe simple ghost tsushima released steam played look like worse version value proposition ubisoft make really dont get half dullard thread havent watched video regurgitating tired garbage slop fed culture war youtubers nevertheless cant help disappointed direction take based preview period history nobunagas murder ascension toyotomi tokugawa really interesting especially eye outsider like yasuke nobunaga rose power flaunting previous convention warfare driving early modernlike reform administration warfare barbarity caught wa murdered general could plunged japan back another century disunity warring state outsider like yasuke bought nobunaga precisely would done show power prestige could show real conflict yasuke watch master push loyalty limit ordering brutal killing enemy instead blandifying like every go kill mitsuhides soldier bad man killed lord looking cheap valhalla go sale imma patient gamer fightincowboy ha video demonstrates bland wanting feudal japan year add bulky nba player kick small asian around like football come fuck ubisoft couldve best bf ha way many review lately wa either right lying wrong said great bad far review positive score look awful ngl another l rather ghost yotei remember running gag ubi would bust feodal japan would mean company trouble impression suck well seeing wa delayed twice giving much hope hilarious almost talking completely gliding gaming community seems give shit hopefully sink ubi look good however mention better time playing female character utilises stealth combat climbing etc far better think time unless get forced male character especially want japanese character japanese setting thing seen previes eagle crap actually scout target foot dynamic stealth problem exist cant tag every single enemy outpost instantly mystical shit heard little modernanimas interruption dont mind choice switch heavy melee player think way swap character cumbersome eventually pain able reach every sync point unless stealth character also suck instantly switching daynight actually like forced condition occcur season sound really interesting way change world sure fit story perspective could cool still think given size world struggle finish sucker japan general probably still buy crazy see single review say yep right yeah havent good since syndicate girl simply way better nature stealthyin stealthy nah hasnt really much fun new ubisoft feel like giant bloated interactive todo list fun experience uh oh comment vote ratio thread absolutely ridiculous usual many weird take mean didnt like past ubi isnt surprising theyre much fast food type either eat stuff dont like nobody wa surprised previewers say fun apparently story ha intrigued character differently kind see character old fan prefer stealth newer fan prefer new wreck everything gameplay excited still wait full review really dont like combat anyone expecting ubislop ive heard acg skillup many discrepancy overlap consensus seems yet another okay probably nothing rock boat rather forgettable writing weird dichotomy term gameplay personally think shouldve focussed naoe actual gameplay background samurai theyre warrior seeing yasuke climb make laugh bit wearing fucking tenton armor im exaggerating huge sword wouldnt even get wall able break stone balustrade also funny wouldve made yasuke samurai question perfectly honest would maybe either turned samurai portion different gameplay element entirely maybe like coop partner character instead separately like yasuke break open door naoe opening door simple example yasuke enter almost bit like puzzle multiple way go tackle mission instead choosing character entire mission last ubisoft rip ninja ha asked since day still fumbled look like fun dont see point make wan na ghost tsushima tenchu instead boring point love ubisoft drowning begged ninja decade sure knew would banger thats left idea rainy day taking storm instead big gun wet rusty another u soft another flopaaaaa strange say wanted system slaughtering funsies others shown man could wanted assasinate nobunaga black dude might samurai look fun stealth instant buy get bored switch yasuke deff gon na pre order tho cause ubisoft run well day imma deff get yeah gon na flop hard end ubisoft review reminded still got syndicate finish currently installing finally finish ghost bloatshima interesting actually gave code bioware didnt veilguard another bargain bin title something ever grab full price mean get push buy ubisoft subscription model since get access everything price matter mediocre im still buying sub isnt company support anymore way cant wait tencent buying ubisoft literally fair price ten cent compared assasins bbc samurai breaking news hardest please reviewer ever doesnt like shocking entire world sound like even bigger cluster fuck thought would least could yasuke make actually fun use look like braindead god mode button mashing option sort alternate approach apparently even personality two protagonist similarly dry boring wouldve thought ubisoft wasnt fun deep deep sale month two release anyone debating look like fine holiday season wonder seeing big burly african man slaughtering smaller japanese dude could trigger japanese gamers cant see overly popular anyway think ghost tshushima better acshadows anyway seems like shoehorned yasuke sake rather focus ninja well skill said must true fuck ubiwoke absolute majority review praising redditor decided choose didnt like reddit idiotic havent watched video skill genuinely seems miserable talking lol truly hope dogwater franchise dy entry naoe mean use unless get forced would far better done past two character similar get choose male female guess ill dammit ubisoft cant keep getting away well least make sort sense cant imagine black guy would able inconspicuous feudal japan yasuke useless tank unkillable making incredibly boring think much depends style watching hand mortisimal enjoyed playing yasuke made clear wa better stealth sneaking got toy related wa aligned straight combat could well pretty much andy reload jorraptor said hour test also useless wa described yasuke fact thought yasuke felt broken never died playing since yasukes free running stealth capability hamstrung point barely real option wa straight combat make boring since cant use two pillar series variety damn least syndicate jakob could still stealth albeit le effectively evie got spotted easier time combat think wa point character choose previewers say character differently want go attack everyone go yasuke want stealthy go naoe personally love seeing far kind like trying old new fan would enjoy depending character yk would thought yasuke black would make better choice stealth hj make sense want tanky sword skater yasuke switch instantly probably combat though youre locked probably retooled syndicate idk taking toolset away yasuke kinda dumb well seems like feature bug lot think stealth tedious dull pick character doe combat time instead anyone surprised wa added afterthought look ha main gripe ha improved initial reveal tbh lot focused argued amongst way much whether yasuke real samurai opinion centered around protag keep system accessible keep story focused even made male samurai guy japanese lead problem dual toolkits would still persist think reason split gimmick wa ghost tsushima basically took ideal vision set historical japan definitely see sucker punch ghost set china theyre done ghost yotei yasuke apparently also kill street repercussion think thats large black samurai let easily blend crowd feudal japan shit happened take two whole mom would cool stuff dad played supporting role almost didnt really need add second character series whole calling card killing secret could possibly screw actually mirage hour point still valid valhalla wa bloated ive played bungie brag perfecting second combat filling hour gameplay problem isnt loop repetitive fun gaming hour bit generous lol described every single hour hour hour even minute gameplay loop fine know trick player fun interesting connection loop many recent sadly didnt pretty much like open world fr used love past havent respected player time would say thatand thats fine loop fun somehow evole bit go always market everyone thats sure enjoyed million last wasnt ive never put close hour even valhalla went forever want time long longest third person action want combat deep barebones hack slash want stealth gameplay epic much depth would stealth section otherwise stealthless ability mechanic arent intricate interesting enough carry size experience want ssstier action elaborate social stealth like hitman could see favorite amen really enjoyed viking got certain amount hour tapped friend dude loooooooooves long insane also doesnt life way social life responsibility suffer wa ok odyssey love ancient greek shiz key good enough dont notice problem modern origin odyssey valhalla hour yeah duh wasnt problem real ubisoft decided ruin franchise tiny minority player whined massively popular franchise online yes thats video work whats problem miss didnt noticeable level system thats reason dropped origin back never looked back system ridiculous use every ubisoft else going sell exp boost alex navarro nextlander said podcast still high level area map similar previous somewhere video yasuke say naoe could climb whats point playing yasuke naoe anything cant itll half price july month ubisoft youre cool time limit finish christmas youre generous hell available summer currently playstation store preorders ubisoft still exists tradition ubisoft norway wa far best part valhalla got worse got britain doe say review say doesnt like modern like probably like true think valuable came away praising would signal didnt enjoy previous worth checking course like opinion useless also say video check video like lowkey hated valhalla well fantasy stuff wa shoved main campaign checked uh yeahhe say first minute video valhalla sucked much actually like odyssey hour bloat doesnt much hurt said wa worth ending wa good agree bloated underwhelming agree silly comment enjoys problem origin odyssey valhalla theyre incredibly loosely set universe almost every gameplay element totally different original fan actually enjoyed arent bad theyre different simply kind actual fan ever saidtheyre also terrible little interesting development universe mean hot minute since wa good let fair odyssey incredible die hill wasnt exactly left long likely planned guaranteed money maker franchise lost popularity beaten ghost tsushima far better long time ubisoft didnt want want make set japan shit already many set japan coverage preview event wa positive also preorders country playstation store preorders get fact straight try jumping ubisoft bad echo chamber dont think theyve messed expect greatness anything short unacceptable wan na smash face able want sneak hit square fan anymore latest sold incredibly well true somehow feudal japan saturated next year ninja gaiden black phantom blade ghost yotei filling roughly similar setting virtue signalling inclusivity place black man japan place would rather yasuke mainline quest giver mc like historical figure portrayed think know went yasuke didnt go yasuke went historical revisionist version yasuke ha making living insisting samurai thomas lockleys book sold history book west fiction japan even claim without proof word yasuke may made oda nobunagas head went theyre trying appeal modern audience ive hoping japanbased since first played honestly seeing kind stuff sloppy gotten past decade never wanted get bankrupcy speedrun rumour believed originally japanese male character got replaced yasuke blm protest true probably saw yasuke wa real person history wa easy way add black playable character rumour lot time complete bullshit would make sense little reason japanese male character easily could added yasuke story non playable character ikr wasnt even real samurai honorary downvoted stating truth pretty damn obvious lol interesting relatively enigmatic historical figure little known give lot work basically ideal choice thats loosely based history still take lot liberty within margin also foreigner somewhat unused japanese custom history give convenient excuse hed thing explained might go without saying otherwise loved ghost tsushima looking forward well good ghost lack area specifically like weapon variety split dedicated samurai character yasuke v ninja character naoe allows two completely different fighting style naoe fighting would expect ninja fantasy lot acrobatics trickery grappling hook parkour also look smoother frankly fun gots love got jin always fight like samurai combat ever us katana parkour clunky best skillup ha negative review lately due internetvideogame tribalism able take constructive criticism decided easier hate rather understand nuance personal opinion yea dont always agree always agree reasoning helped ensure ill mainly playing naoe point system individually average great switch easily wa spot take personal opinion glaze skillup hard disagree lot recent take started bayonetta button mashing lmao like skill ups take remember really annoyed review ff pregame launch eat word came still good enjoyed didnt love like wa anticipating skill isnt shill least compare luke stephen massive shill release corporate opinion first theyve totally bought release

like skill truth deleted review praise guy decided post didnt like yeah wa happy mirage wa short ended got bored wasnt planning playing gave shot way hell wa going spending another hour odyssey origin good traditional way entire rpgs entry series might still hope got repetitive gameplay loop well made art direction visuals maybe give u world little immersive im counting oh brother got lifted nearly everything lol gots world pretty fucking barren little verticality stealth wa also barebones compared whats offer ha le gameplay feature see went take yasuke think defo might okay perspective taking limelight cause sound interesting enough like imagine getting make small choice like nobunaga want turn x ally maybe get choose betray consequence action bear fruit get betrayed suddenly whole new plot twist maybe cause wa even partially naoe set dual protagonist side something noooo ubi wanted big tank man bash slash wagh watching animation stabbing enemy neck helmet pop health damage lol ubisoft livestreaming yesterday went showcase pet dog animation legit bugged say really delaying polish several delay several apology japan imagery ubisoft verge bankruptcy end good itll miracle qad month ago great lol thats ubi forced story wanted wa caught entirely surprise badly everyone disliked went way apologize thats bad wa shit proof fact even though month year still talk shit every video downvoted shit gon na sell like dogshit theyll blame player look amazing cant wait doesnt every ubisoft nowadays got wa p looked stunning ninja gaiden ghost yotei phantom blade really spoiled year completely different genre lot talking ubisoft go sure looking like flop ill waiting review im forced male character ill pas guy knew wa knew since reddit negative review get upvotes funny talking skillups review mentioning anything numerous positive preview guess doesnt fit narrative acg even luke stephen left impressed played review praise thats matter amazing sort controversial top comment lmao cant let others enjoy thing anymore dev post talked wanted system youll either pay wait season change wanted level lowered valhalla wa piece donkeyshit best selling fact ppl kind dont give fuck current wokeantiwoke beef gaming probably lag behind expectation im pretty sure finacial success youll eat slop youll enjoy deleted last review hand positive followed stalker wa buggy af dragon age positive review wtf oj mostly review bigger release yeah pretty dire state recently also spends lot time weekly show understand let pick going handful moment nope theyve said interview choose part part story require two specifically hope literally want lol think swap ive seen far seems like naoe ha tank youll demolished actual combat dont know dodgeparry yasuke ha shit poor ability imagine going annoying encountering situation want approach certain way character youre wont let yasuke doesnt much flavor term exploration gameplay yasukes weapon large melee ranged melee focused dictating controlling space exploration slower fine give new interaction like stamen bar spice thing naoe ha classic movement able prone use grappling hook fight style also heavy parry dodge seeing ha much le hp think mean type type b dont worry wont theyll bankrupt soon hilarious better stealth night like meme guy turning light smilling imagine something like half meter taller everyone around built like brick shit house trying parkour wearing full iron samurai armour probably doesnt make someone stealthy think wa written drew crowd much early wa issue thats exactly problem character exact way nothing stopping playing jacob stealthily playing evie tank make whole dual character thing unecessary especially endgame acquire skill difference stat difference provided outfit even doesnt differentiate enough bloated either character movement travel dialogue slower odysseya famously huge travel fast hated dont understand looking tbh hated desmond modern day setting got rid complained modern day connection whats happening getting stale rebuilt ground origin complained new direction complained bloat new made mirage hated win scenario point ive enjoyed every ive played want head toward clear endgame far cry wa even worse least valhalla fun story wa relatively fun combat sneak far cry god damn valhalla wa insane didnt single extra activity inside valhalla map either valhalla much promise completely fizzled slog wa certain point liked valhalla played well yeah stop playing month wa like complete much filler recently stop mirage maybe ¾ couldnt continue maybe ill pick still long honest problem high production value fact mediocre every facet graphic fine story fineish dialogue often bland voice acting hit miss mission usually samey cost lot money dont offer lot varied gameplay repetitive gameplay cost buck cost real crux le yes quality inbetween stuff matter bg wa similar gameplay loop across long quality writing choice presented player felt like narrative experience even odyssey felt like wa enough plot new system carry run time yes good enough depth variety make instance gameplay loop distinct unique enough detail feel different every time remain challenging throughout shallow gameplay wise keep gameplay loop interesting difficult challenging enough get boring quickly every hour easily put hour witcher baldurs gate give two example vastly engaging recent acsfar cry miss didnt noticeable level system miss dont assassinate someone sleep wake level different yeah played triology ffs boss challenge locked behind story progression whoopsie ennemy level get fucked ppl truly suck stealth veilguard number po steam fucking steam studio crumbling never said wont sell initially thats say said fan modern find reviewer well see think actually opinion would useful even loved recent hating latest reason good indicator youd enjoy new full agree get second third opinion wait ghost yōtei pc god im unreasonably excited probably year away wa conspiracy theory didnt make japan wa easy fucking money back well ghost tsushima filled hole pretty damn well late tbh gots simple narrative made standard lost popularity mirage last year well smaller didnt review well issue yasuke internet ha memed complained much really taint wa naoe would way positive reception yeah yasuke japan set brilliant love make two pc nah seems like overshoot bit missed opportunity better reach japanese audience part black man kill asian woman video wa hilarious ubisoft really didnt think bunch idiot yasuke deserves either yasuke ha portrayed samurai japanese developed nioh big think unique take yasuke least ha revisionist history fucking time sake ridiculous illuminati plot specific example egregious others funny source claiming yasuke wa samurai trace back thomas lockley end ha vested interest pushing narative sell book source yasuke confirms wa nobunaga took liking include court nothing samurai fuck sudden interested debating historical accuracy werent arm socrates george washington leonardo davinci entirely accurate lmao think know issue isnt even yasuke dual protagonist direction bother combat heavy samurai literal ninja right naoe shouldve main focus yasuke protagonist doesnt seem purpose outside power fantasy wa development long lmfao complete bullshit iirc card japanese named taka also cool fact learned protagonist name bird prey related altar ezio mean eagle taka mean hawk whats source rumour arse rumour explanation heard popularity ghost tsushima male female japanese protagonist ran risk unfavorably compared ghost tsushima published rumour believed originally japanese male character got replaced yasuke blm protest thats literally true corroborated anywhere made culture war bullshit unless source rumour share isnt first likely wont last make yasuke actual samurai nioh thing interesting figure history like exploring possibility samurai already difficult class establish period used kind bodyguard nobility used word bushi mononofu describe became later edo period samurai account right bear arm stipend would make samurai much actual samurai earned right bear weapon wa given residence thing associated given samurai samurai youll ever obvious lol outsider allows interesting story told reason varangian guard eastern roman empire wa famed prestige bodyguard outsider signaled power roman emperor african experiencing culture shock japan certainly new plenty white already still omg exotic japan bit annoying unless characterize yasukes cultural background useless baseline likely westerner pov could nice player moreso character thrown try piece cultural aspect playing like soft doe like dune novel doe think started cyberpunk review review clearly go alley combat system dislike default thats unprofessional like sending guy hate platformers review astrobot spend review complaining innovation concept different mechanic thats whats irritating disagrees something doesnt mean wrong agree disagree right thats beauty personal opinion basically evertime skillup give negative review alwasy add something along line personally didnt like several thing therefore recommend like thing may enjoy really need learn disagree someone without lowering opinion developer said would mix older modern onesbut gameplay weve seen ha made clear wa true example plenty care even smallest bit research interview ign look brand general lot stealth focus first rpg saw rise rise combat origin feel mixing whole era bringing return stealth focus maybe misunderstood know previous spongy enemy guess ninja stealth focused youre playing character enemy le spongy make sense stabbing dude stealth hit ko take slash katana kill doe ha make sense though part rpg gameplay get main draw stealth look good main focus always hoped japan inspired would ninja themed stealth hidden assassination poison spying focus somewhere market newer player enjoy open world wait check couple full review ghost yotei around corner even releasing year ghost yotei p exclusive always pretty sure ubisoft plus least pc ha latest might subscribe month two outlaw etc without buy either yep wa dragon age veilguard next avowed week release obnoxious loud correct ding correct answer dislike culture vulture much make hard care way another leaf cultural zeitgeist either find unbiased reviewer farming click see public sentiment whove actually played im going waste money proving anyone wrong ill still patient either way funny right side selling well either gamers somehow right wing trump supporter right side make trash politically motivated even folk find boring playing dont pretty much everyone released preview today yet posted upvoted front page sub literally remaining credible journalist thankfully turned around definitely seemed attempt hide post generally agree skill ups review nobody said arent good rating well matter fact odyssey second favorite black flag point company ubisofts standing resource embarrassed releasing time charging fir course love passion making aint nobody stupid enough believing something business wanting make money ha long passed profiteering realm taking advantage inflation video rise massive increase programmersdevelopers working peanut working intern code refinement half devs made wa first guy ubisoft management said thought liked new prince persia yeah sure sure sure thinking making obviously wasnt best intention forced certain mission maybe wa big reviewer youtube call veilguard wa maybe cause positive preview text skillup actually showing footage issue ha also many preview site gave glowing preview like veilguard outlaw etc guess fact dont work narrative true personally tend always agree acg liked high chance skillup mostly miss sometimes doe get right well though fully respect opinion hell yeah brother yasuke mj almost syndicate japan video switch character whenever skill ups complaint well oh cant whole japan japanese sound exact syndicate werent mission locked jacob evie alone yes surely particular mission strength player character arent going put mission full parkour make character cant unless disadvantage story driven segment tenchu created blue print like year ago wa copy funny finally feudal japan saying never would going poor help somehow fuck feudal japan star samurai process like dont think folk would expect armored samurai able parkour though skillup apparently doe mission yasuke able usesqueeze though hole naoe funny like isnt reason cant somehow use hole first five minute squatting next video could easily let size strength apart exploration could barrel wall mantle quickly thing normally need hook push heavy thing bend tree climb take advantage fact ha like ft lb everyone around type c always left damn shame ronejoke theyll bankrupt time theyve unprofitable let check note month least reddit think theyre dying would ubisoft employing ship going going bang firework mentality isnt surprising seems like instance ubi corrected making character different doesnt matter tho cause ill playing naoe absolutely eivor felt like old steam boat sluggish enjoyed part wa much filler answer simple different complained different thing ubisoft listened inevitability designing product consumer im sure clear direction last rebooted seem sold well loved odyssey disliked bloat valhalla slow tanky protagonist felt havent played mirage yet cant know yet delayed due controversy suicide squad rarely perform well dont pick ubisoft unless deep sale anyway ill wait sure hope enjoy loved desmond modern day story thats held interest killing basially killed series tried next couple got bored without desmond dislike desmonds story line wa like literally half fun long time fan orgin ody good balance val wa bland term story even world wa bit flat mirage wa bit boring bring back og formula complaint large number complaint dont touch ever need issue latch onto ha also wide fan base almost year around fuck many diffrent take series mirage wa built top valhalla engine clearly suffered implemented old system lacked depth fluidity old implemented smaller linear story played like glorified side quest far depth wa concerned moved back focus actual brotherhood didnt explore anything new even slightly interesting failed developer didnt understand good wa primary motive franchise reboot wa add mtxlootbox im dont know opinion general consensus saw review mirage felt like short valhalla cutscenes still cinematic enough like unity parkour valhalla wasnt good fighting also similar iirc stealth tool like throwing knife yeah looked like short valhalla return form didnt end playing ubisoft hater always hate ubisoft matter theyll keep moving goalpost whenever hate isnt relevant anymore thing hate thing theyll love thing didnt like mirage seemed half assed much preferred going back smaller setting le bloat seemed like afterthought rather main entry asking return original style didnt hit mark thing like parkour still lifeless rpg version bit tacked om many wont admit ubisoft overhated online opinion definitely make someone jump bandwagon even though never played take odyssey example bought sale long time ago hesitate try heard many negative finally give try month ago actually regret dont sooner say arent completely wrong bloating map story focus isu also isnt everything core still fun story decent kasandra likable actually best char already completed almost hour course cant speak everyone point easy hate nowadays always complaint doesnt mean suck still case hated maybe rpg era fan want hour gameplay valhalla damn near meanwhile series fan prerpg actually found return form highly praise best postorigins start rpg series release isnt hour goddamn gameplay binge weekend two done liked desmond loli wa expecting desmond slowly absorbing skill time animus maybe present day segment moved along capping mostly present day desmond full historical stabbing simulator fine isnt wa looking bounced desmond died make hard figure enjoy played release took long break stroy wa justdone came back origin odyssey liked later ed felt bit chore guess thats completing bought unity sale wa really great little throwback preorigins remember secretly hoping remake get black flag im wondering enjoy mirage taste really hesitated valhalla since many reviewer trust said leaned part annoyed oddyssey modern day setting wasnt hated part story wa absolutely shit wa bad writing made hate modern setting youre explaining nobody ubisoft ha kind creative vision didnt understand hated thing couldnt correct hated modern section halfbaked desmond ha personality sack potato response shouldnt cut put kind effort origin threw bunch unrelated trending mechanic series without thought whether theyd undermine core concept noticed nowin scenario ubisoft certainly cant win dont know anything assemble pile feature hope come end video look everyones favourite aaaa pirate took year come worse le featurecomplete version theyd already made wa pissed got rid desmond spent getting trained modern day stabbing said fuck story doesnt matter anymore single entityhivemind im absolutly torn apart valhalla played hella lot release overlapped month unemployment probably sunk easily hour right release version finished odyssey wa fascinating many good feature missing stuff wa added later patch still valhalla always burned memory slow im sure exactly caused feel way maybe meh story wa clearly cut part desmond perfect example dont cater fanbase follow vision modern story wa main driver remember talking friend dope modern day wa going playing desmond whole time guess happens try gain biggest possible audience get lot different view point personally didnt mind desmond always thought actual wa better realworld stuff syncing shit really didnt significant role neither story gameplay quite pointless superfluous rather think actual modern day aclike might good honest formula ha always rather bland matter much try change always create something generic fun long time origin odyssey valhalla tried reinvent get completely new audience time forgetting supposed huge openworld thousand upon thousand pointless map marker forced xp grind shelling actual money xp booster many pointless fetchy side quest none bad theyre mediocre imho youre like deep series every new entry still mediocre maybe dont know make anything else make sense least desmond wa connected insane wanted modern day stuff desmonds arc instead modern day got fucking whackier whackier like loki real stuff abstergo wa adding real history mirage wasnt like different rest modern throwback og still felt like valhalla dlc think thats something series see release either change nothing get stale change something ruin half userbases fun change something else ruin half fun sure solution rather preorder pick review patch thank mate busy trying please generate sale instead making fun interesting example clear development put character mc naoe yasuke please dont want woman odyssey female character wa canon changed halfway feedback make male playable supposedly female character canon mc valhalla used male marketing true suspect marketing female mc result le interest le preorderssales played far cry didnt enjoy much least wa much shorter valhalla went much booted far cry yesterday nicer wa course personal preference took hour get achievement crazy hour achievement wa never ending enjoyed moment wish ended earlier maybe better small chunk cant say im excited wa like picked bought mirage le think im patient gamer rarely buy full price right point made bg many different encounter interesting npc storyline associated modern dont really health bar open world action became first sign descent shitty pseudo rpg bloatware wa kinda dropped wa introduced origin think sneaking someone take hide body wa whole point grinding levelsno thx always say watch review well making mind put negative review wa confused reread saw pc fuck youre right take damn long sometimes hundred percent like imagine someone shitting pant ubi hq going noo didnt bag merde make vite vite like ghost tsushima especially stealth included package like got wa mostly samurai slap fight dont think wouldve seen double ubi especially since recent plot centered around mediterranean general area would make sense narratively toy notable land around area maybe even old roman smth boom ofuq japon yasuke ha romanticized lot sure wa first black man japanese history wa shocking oda nobunaga wanted see yasuke strip washed believing ink kind seeing yasuke turn darker scrubbed oda decided keep yasuke around retinue ever since thing lasted le year know diary someone witnessed yasuke survived honnoji incident disappeared afterwards ha seen since problem isnt portrayed fact devs insisted wa factually accurate used thomas book factual proof im paraphrasing course long time since went rabbit hole downvoted speaking truth length go make ubisoft bad everyone say rpg sold say want valhalla odyssey sold gang buster clearly market power fantasy type character yasuke wa made player want aaa title end always would expect take yr minimum single studio japanese anime studio made anime demon magic stuff yeaanythings possible modern culture war redditors radicalized ever decade ago could drop black female main character without anyone blinking history heavily debated perfect character inserted japanese story era make plausible deleted yes fun varangian guard outsider viking totally different christian greek culture fought differently roman wore different armor weapon sang different song completely different custom werent interested politics whats fun yasuke becomes completely assimilated japanese culture seriously act different japanese despite japan le month brings nothing african origin reviewing franchise admitted liking past stated multiple time doesnt like modern hell even doe video would like going reviewing fifa hate football believe taste range never step comfort zone pretty narrow view take mate tbf thats worked even og trilogy ezio could repeatedly bash someone head mace stealth kill single hit small blade videogames suspension disbelief always required chance naoes challenge setup eg stealthing right location identifying npc pathing yasukes would whatever combat system like parrying dodging itd realistic naoe also struggle combat wouldnt make great gameplay reveal trailer said completely forgot ubisoft plus im type wait sale ubisoft regularly go sale tbf culture war avowed wa started director guy youtube would call journalist lmao skillup journalist lol yall lost fucking plot cynical hateful even credible used feel way guess taste changed lately disagreeing lot review looking outlet often day doe recommend something enjoy thats objectively false journalist biased pretentious cynical influencers industry chosen jfuckingskillupesus take reskin wa made year like calling sony sequals reskins theyre spending year remaking texture ubisoft went way give something different protagonist costing yasuke controversy wait year make new many bought lol ubisofts beloved seem sell worst wa blast fun experience latelywhat shame charged aaa cost buck max opinion invalidates rest mean wasnt also person said cyberpunk wa fantastic launch due instance invalidate review yeah could made yasuke badass major npcally story instead generic tank character gon na use michael jackson mary jane yeah useless mj spiderman see option enjoyed combat originsodysseyvalhalla tbf cant possible worse mj stealth section syndicate protagonist could climb sync viewpoint needed cant even climb viewpoint character cant climb still look good yeah wa thought jacob wa brawler evie wa assassinish main story mission youd occasionally get locked exploration stuff could wanted preview ive seen far yasuke doesnt really strength jank melee combat fan wont like need new tenchu know ballpark glad see ninja garden announcement today havent played long time might getting name wrong tesshu wa good id liked see yasuke wa simular like maybe samurai suit funny finally feudal japan saying never would going poor help funny often get repeated exaggerated time first never said anything dude alex hutchinson directed exactly said hed prefer novel time period directly asked dude never worked another wasnt charge franchise hasnt even worked ubisoft year even quickly walked back statement saying obviously japan would great setting wa simply interested personally lesser known setting internal interview say completely opposite team ha planning japan since basically forever course always cracked refused tackle u grew movie wanted badly kid tell though fatal playthrough going full ghost got absolutely insane like dont think folk would expect armored samurai able parkour though skillup apparently doe didnt ghost tsushima realism dont really go hand hand anyway given ghost probably going simultaneously better melee stealth uh franchise id expect something cool sinking ship franchise never issue getting typec edit usb joke stock since still havent made back loss bankruptcy probably getting bought real possibility lol closed studio last month laid almost employee thats shutting spent know much may dying yet theyre hurting pretty bad saying theyre dying studio since far cry lol complete idiot see ubisoft ha completely melting past three year releasing bomb bomb belief anymore even devs fed profitable like said wouldnt talking liquidating big wig eivor also absolutely personality compared kassandra well cant listen right opinion think problem distinct fanbases fan newer fan older ezio trilogy black flag unity marketing mirage especially also supposed appeal fan older somehow stealth parkour still shit like newer combat like newer making fanbases hate think like toxic complaining matter like first played due nostalgia hate everything newer origin well boat main reason didnt like modern setting wa mainly due end trilogy desmond power could parkour bit wa inside dull interior tight parkour v rest altairezioconnor much freedom fun environment feel like continued desmonds story would seen actually go dev wouldve spent proper resource craft world killed gameplay remember desmond last awkward level lead group glad v another group wished seen desmond bloom think lot wa desmond wa boring badlywritten character wa basically walking macguffin agency saga hour whining life whatever tell finally becoming little interesting right dy odessy wa hated community loved everyone else got many goty nomination star war pretty big flop indicates online hate reddit user much experienced hate mediocre thing bit quickly time somewhat right ubisofts sale definitely arent getting better ubisofts share dropping year past year pretty clear indicator investor also agree havent met anyone genuinely enjoyed fc played every fc installment fc slogfest throughout honestly hoped fleshed story coop since fc wa fun ha interesting premise gu fring ubisoft somehow fumbled bad mention undercooked system length river raid fucking awesome concept got though boiled mini loop could experience basically first hour tripping werent health bar first thank feel like wa saying origin wa anymore mediocre rpg tacked yeah hoping itll shorter time around doubt thing yasuke ha portrayed exactly portrays many medium product across anime manga literally decade precisely unique figure japanese history mundane though reality situation may may outrage inclusion frankly absurd disingenuous culture war horseshit got kind attention big ubisoft crowd always looking next big thing make thinly veiled racist sexist argument bad history remember actually much worse black guy japan wtf major disregard towards japanese culture includes getting season agriculture wrong use torii gate wrong use chinese architecture passing japanese use sacred monument arent allowed medium even got bowing wrong whole yasuke thing wa actually gateway show much worse actually difference japanese werent patting back progressive including insisting yasuke samurai wa historical fact multiple reviewer coming saying yasuke boring character writing naoe made amazing character story another generically bland check box motivated addition beloved franchise make ninja powerful cool ninja always cooler samurai anyway thought faster schedule many theyve churning even changing character way describing mean wouldve development year already like still yes exactly mythologized like many historical figure era japan perfectly normal thing story know wont good review perspective fifa hater consumer fifa hater might change mind isnt called professional showed good example downvote without actual response ign sent someone hated crpgs review bg would riot youtubers act like totally fine professional review playing something outside taste oh damn totally missed cant wait feeling hell get new opportunity outside obsidian release completely irrelevant ally like would actually awesome stealth time shit go big hulking samurai come start laying waste know didnt michael jordan junk auch goddamn jesus christ historically accurate think wa never really samurai couldnt sword fight speak japanese dude wa novelty wa paraded around japanese ruler time kind redeem sequel yasuke definitely overpowered combat compared naoe problem almost completely useless come parkourstealth imagine wanting fun time pretending samurai beautiful world theyve created keep swapping back naoe whenever want climb tower unlock viewpoint playing yasuke look like fun change norm almost go core gameplay mechanic entire franchise ghost tsushima samurai gameplay worked wa designed around combine seamlessly stealthghost gameplay theyre forcing pick designed around new samurai character locked completing certain content isnt thats confusing design want change character try different gameplay experience im forced different combat system dont know make sense still feel weird considering tenchu p wa theeeeeee shit ninja garden thats id like ninja character stealthily working garden without seen task set upon cast interesting character unlocking ability else im sorry aragami wa attempt spiritual successor aragami got pretty close couldnt quite nail tenchuz xbox wa probably fun ever played player coop mastered wa straight kind horrifying watch like wave broken scream blood crashing map master ninja silently executed every finished longest coop map highest difficulty minute detection wa like playing ninja old movie suddenly wa around crowded place also variety execution animation depending standing started best friend preference flip enemy neck snap could sword standing front left target still unseen basically catch corner land directly front jump grapple execute became signature online main story wa terrible forced combat bos fight bad hurt sale enough never make another team would limp make another failure demon soul director wa replaced miyazaki turned celebration clunk difficulty dark soul know rest elden ring dont tenchu stealth fan im sure pleased shook like elden ring damn miss tenchu sekiro wa tantalizingly close still quite nectar need look micro usb really cold need adult played alexios plus im greek made even funnier recycled kassandras model randhvi whatever shes called valhalla meh indeed yet bought last sale im currently playing black flag totally see difference appreciate element hard please crowd odyssey valhalla backlog always big damnit back beginning franchise like day everyone thought multiple historical era eventually lead modern dayheavy entry ha primarily desmond master time modern day templar plan fall apart ezio popular made trilogy killed desmond unceremoniously jump popular end world meme biggest problem modern day story stuff badass get end act story major implication said badass life get pulled schmuck named desmond absurdly boring contrast huge momentum killer vocal minority think make huge segment market feel aggrieved ubisoft isnt catering dropping storyline wa going nowhere wa completely uninteresting wa remember likely far went myth bos fight wa ody strongest world best side quest cult system wa also really well done star war generally franchise downtrend overexposed outlaw also got midish review normies pay attention thing like metacritic ign score enemy health bar lol rest reddit living rock dont pretend werent mad white guy protagonist nioh also last samurai saw plenty hate whitewashing accusation despite fact two protagonist like yasuke based real historical figure side bad hunch initially want protag samurai ninja hybrid go head combat day stealth approach cool ninja gadget night since ghost tsushima release way concept abandoned prevent protag similarity jin sakai spend review complaining innovation concept different mechanic okay thats thing though almost every ubisoft right like thats unprofessional like sending guy hate platformers review astrobot ign sent someone hated crpgs review bg would riot youtubers act like totally fine even someone doesnt like genregame still provide insight others cant granted ign doe said thats ign guy making bad review professional review playing something outside taste skillup talking dont understand whats issue dont watch often review tend fine even said didnt recommend liked noting wasnt bad fan first would enjoy wa point probably component yeah also dual character system cool idea thats executed well recently spiderman like wa totally thoughtless design decision implemented well didnt megajoule mahjong praised historically accurate yet kicked nioh thousand time course true accurate history japan somehow ubisoft thought yep thats protagonist think shouldve focused naoe since think mostly anyways whole time wa watching video kept thinking ghost tsushima worse like talked yasuke able assassinate enemy engaging others sure seems like would nice something like standoff system even blue indicator parry iirc direct carryover ghost tsushima guess ill find year sale included playstation sure seems like ubisoft got kinda hung idea got ended creating something kinda worst world like worse version syndicate howd whole even worse another concept go still screw sound like sort quick swap feature lol correction hide rake grapple wall actually tending neighbor garden need come back maybe thing thought amount ninja released recently coming sekiro wa tantalizingly close still quite nectar need wasnt wanted sekiro started tenchu became sekiro certain point development strayed much youd probably dig origin wa curious cuz loved origin odyssey didnt click thanks reply still dont understand killed death wasnt needed make plot happen killed protagonist could felt like everyone thought multiple historical era eventually lead modern dayheavy entry ha primarily desmond master time modern day templar thats pretty much felt tbh thought wa building desmond going templar modern day specially clunky desmonds parkour introduced thought paved way next installment well able control oftenparkour modern day setting ded wasnt funny many say black flag fav seems create beloved make least like altair health bar theyre talking enemy health bar kidding reddit glaze origin best constantly side jfc get outta wa virtually backlash nioh time near anything ha seen anyway fact probably gamers gamers though sad fact u dumb disengaged see yet another white savior narrative ridiculous unnecessary niohs context damaging culture large actually love last samurai though think actually contextualized tom cruise character enough history make complaint white main character le convincing id argue fact poorly implemented show wa totally thoughtless design decision wanted force character vision system would bring anything value gameplay locked must playable character george floyd protest dev talk im hungry still cant believe ubisoft somehow managed fumble japan place wasnt two character basically im sure like love egypt setting fact im eagerly waiting tomb raider remaster next month least trace path really unity map element like mechanic ui design gameplay world design etc utmost ease cant later title show someone clip odyssey theyll think theyre completely separate series newer might good right complaint theyre entirely valid theyve deviated far cognizable aspect series youre past murdering sometimes stealthily also constantly full original thinker opinion directly comment im replying also time release odyssey origin wa despised remember new always bad old good shouldnt even considered point anything origin branded new series think ubi wa scared need name brand help sale get mad last samurai think movie saying tc read somewhere female mc supposedly dont sell ubisoft shoehorned yasuke hilariously stupid like several level lara croft anyone dont think argument make sense wa bad decision maybe theyre following

perfect descriptor deep throating calling absolutely amazing full much saying unplayable shit separate others someone miss old style doesnt really like new think enough balance old fan enjoy also without spoiler actually still secondary ive completed every since first launched even collected flag idea adhd probably valhalla first never finished felt burnt new style direction wasnt series loved fine im hater isnt however wanted japan since wa referenced intrigued dont know want spend money give like valhalla feel like would final nail coffin sorry text dump would rather ask someone enjoying

odyssey valhalla pretty bummed drama surrounding got ubisoft subscription wanted star war outlaw im sale per se got money wording dragon age wa using saw poorly actually sold month later ubisoft need well thats seem promoting much seems like pretty steep cope buddy loved odyssey found valhalla extremely boring couldnt actually valhalla wasnt publication arent going observe difference steam player population factoring actual player interest lower wa odyssey remember tlou came raging neckbeards decided despite selling like hotcake wa failure nd week sale week every single big release sale drop second week even gta v bigger drop second week sale genuinely doesnt matter capable rational thought im tired discourse proceeds contribute discourse assumption even releasing sale number youd finding way discredit doubt figure really actually released unambiguous figure woulnd ambiguity around reason playstation xbox ubi store platform dont show player number like ambiguity frame thing like shareholdersplayers judge successful whether ubi shuts sell year agree said thing internet anymore im old enough remember primarily followed supported thing liked found interesting nowadays hate brigade following aroundlike stewie fat guy tuba steam stats deceptive console represent far away primary market like subscription service sale metric nearly talk player free buy intel gpus dang must buying hundred thousand intel gpus peak mean current player playing time player overall steam also platform connect exists consider also buying dont deal shitty drm platform also consider past peak much actually sold ha even week see time dont steam player steam peak time also consistently india reason monster hunter also released recently ha consistently k player k steam suspicious weird specially current issue performance im sure counting ubisoft subscription member player trading day since announcement ha reached past k steam shareholder abandoning ship tell youtube video article

xbox pc thats theyre quoting sale still month ubi think ubisoft hence wording wa reminded ubisoft subscription service dont know many subscriber got free copy gaming laptop wonder counted sale suspicious much good way combine storefront buy steam epic others subscribe ubisoft stream think local library even ha physical copy console nowadays plenty way oftentimes online discourse boil screenshot taken within minute release showing concurrent steam player framing x amount player combine different platform easily wording directly correlate player count often brought conversation nowadays got free recent cpu upgrade cant player steam saying almost million player console number bogus include everyone ubi way ha sold million unit yet chance worded similarly ea worded veilguards failure shareholder dont count theyve activated ive started treating dont go sub new release google thing help negativity time super solid itll endless whining thread singular thing beating dead horse despite best effort dont realize constantly seeing something negative light shape opinion even youre enjoying something surrounded negativity thing youre enjoying still hamper enjoyment psychology work try join bandwagon fun kick straw doll floor wa doll favorite farming show like future let ive fan since first reason think wa going suddenly shit shockingly blast amazing always like degree community become insular almost militant dont go along circlejerk actually like thing emperor influencer top pyramid told cant mention otherwise youre ostracised opinion doesnt value dont following cognitive dissonance particular ha insane ive seen many reviewer glaze non stop throughout review mention couple thing didnt like go recommend almost like feel much pressure hate audience doe always come back indignant paying also thinking developer paid better condition much gaming seems performative virtue signalling nowadays think definitely extension started considering gamers watching streamer never playing rehash streamer opinion without ever actually played general enjoy playing sub karma meta feedback loop think lot type deathly afraid unique opinion taste chance go circlejerk wont consider real gamers despite actually playing im spot ive given movie never wouldve watched chance deeply enjoyed tougher theyre often expensive time commit totally agree finished movie loved went check review saw ton bashing probably wouldnt given chance went review beforehand really want completely stop watchingreading review consumable medium even post consuming negative narrative

anecdote avatar weird perspective everyone around saw first movie wa talk town longest time came second movie came well yet nobody know ha even seen much le talked absolutely confuses hear successful wa mind actually blown hear watched first movie time liked much second wa good special like first exception viral spike first day sale biggest day ever taper similar movie work box office opening weekend isnt huge youre going magically huge weekend sometime later call long tail opening weekend biggest taper like said viral spike like big streamer playing create demand sale continue drop actually sound right sale mostly front loaded type title maybe day specially likely first month even week need lot heavy lifting marketing done waiting anyway le likely want pay full price star war outlaw absolutely didnt hit mil player day ubisoft say outlaw player two day deleted ea microsoft ubisoft use player offer subscription service wirh day release every fucking xbox last many year use

culture evident valhalla wa way much definitely wasnt bad thing wa enjoying felt id seen offer wanted done could see end sight got playtime wa reported around hour story thats right amount typical open world adventure honestly enjoyed new direction went odyssey origin yet valhalla get round time dont get wrong first really good become quite samey black flag wa completely different due whole ship aspect u valhalla lover exist favorite since black flag ha really ever touched part history came right around time really got last kingdom tv show amped love valhalla gameplay may lacking area aesthetic history made really think choose like based interest part history fair complain others dont suffer issue really especially last trilogy absolute racism vitriol receiving though uncalled western crowd ha interest japanese culture way ill never understand right im recovering completionist enjoy leave rest gaming much fun way whatchu like dont like biggest gripe big legitimate gripe sure thats biggest issue probably pretty good lo behold pretty good part enjoyed skipped rest thats exactly supposed modern basically playground enough activity everyone find something interesting howd get repetitive takedown dont mind bloat long enjoyable stopped like kill wa getting simply taking enemy weapon shoving back talking wa sly bash towards acmirage released year ago wa decent although definitely top black flag goat imo ending song perfect remember loading first blown away graphic crowraven remember stuck first time got animus knowing progress thing played everyone since rogue black flag favorite enzio trilogy sadly got talk worked hate really take toll devs pour lot effort keep shitting im glad hear getting good start look fun hating sake hating bit cringe probably bit toward back wa younger literally helping constructive devoid empathy tell lot posting bile web thankfully grew hope well still cant believe tlou reception wa absolutely insane dragon age isnt

influence give awesome glimpse specific place japan history classic cultural stuff ha good despite folk online say pretty darn respectful cant think ha told climb something taboo small shrine pay respect get temporary buff plenty see know fact different preference opinion absolutely loving also generally enjoyed rpg odyssey favorite may eclipse blast perfect course come close well done generally like style like ninja stealth youll likely like quite lot lem thorough stealth greatly improved almost splintercell like prone many avenue hiding offense including water reed breathing pipe especially placed expert mode enemy see rooftop shadowsdarkness huge role lineofsight pressure floor placed throughout japan like irl stop intruder need careful move slowly weather huge role navigate environment breath wild level slippery climbing mostly lineofsight icicle draw attention distract enemy combat tweaked tough youd like rpg element either playing huge role afterthought even set assassination guaranteed like og transmog feature getgo like look item leveling system isnt intrusive rpgs similar origin castle camp clear never seem copypasted unique layout offer variety way tackle assassination mission even spare target analyze beforehand story slowburn first definitely recommend immersive mode canon mode experience really tonally cohesive world story everything connects protagonist wellwritten complicated morality wise world beautiful overwhelmingly large like odyssey valhalla navigate well scouting system great way incentivize player keep target finding manual easy mode speaking scouting build home base pretty indepth system every building place ha meaning cosmetic design crafting story refill scouting mechanic upgrade follow hint place scouting marker give edge finding target microtransactions way relegated store course corner forgot even tbh ha toggle make assassination actually kill everyone definitely return classic also stealth gameplay feel best many tool approach go prone darkness actually hide far amazing also without spoiler actually still secondary two main character arguably main main character literal ninja member japanese brotherhood pretty assassiny separate others character someone miss old style doesnt really like new think enough balance old fan enjoy dont like new style isnt also without spoiler actually still secondary story line really pitch last hour majority revenge plot nothing templar want spend money give like valhalla much shorter valhalla could get doe feel bloated especially arent modern formula around fun odyssey valhalla id tie origin definitely perfect earns price combat ability favorite bit series fighting feel muchheavier older like new style enjoyed origin odyssey mirage old similar really hated valhalla wa bloated im really enjoying far stealth gameplay really really good huge improvement every title playing immersive japaneseportuguese va also good nothing drastic separate others imo similarly origin odyssey valhalla except definitely feel polished action stealth like old liked origin youll like origin odyssey definitely different type wa reluctant origin even odyssey took year decide give go theyre great bit big taste single player content every corner empty world odyssey origin feel like rdr titan quest baby thats came played pretty much anything odyssey got unity valhalla mirage sitting library ill odyssey done least main story cod fun shitty business practice wa playing odyssey awhile long kept thinking quest going change matter world quest valhalla released two year later steam ubisoft saying would never release steam yep definitely thing simultaneous release also anyone ubisoft probably ha discount achievement give discount store probably first discount used new release called maga moron im even talking ubisoft seems every release ha vocal group creating rancid rabid outrage content bad silent hill peaked k ended hitting million sale p pc origin peaked steam sold million copy peak playercount k look peak player valhalla odyssey many copy sold steam right way measure success ubisoft launcher odyssey peaked k sold copy playerbase isnt pc getting someone get subscription good even better time purchase considering hate ubisoft would assume ubi something dont got many sub potentially keep subscriber good ubisoft seen reddit bad bankrupted odyssey sold million copy k peak day steam release far literally par popular franchise actual mile better imo dragon age veilguard said million player like month launch million player day yes wording far situation didnt release dragon age player number ea financial call january nd wa month veilguard launched wasnt success would try hide number face shareholder like ea veilguard player month blew past two day even remotely comparable publisher subscription model use need pretend grand conspiracy judge successful whether ubi shuts sell year ubisoft shuts youll say youre right dont youll come reason youre actually still right baldurs gate peak k steam also launched console bg currently ha player steam much doe share price take two ha increase consider buying gta doesnt dumb sale disclosed anyone selling selling based feel shareholder arent going told done next financial disclosure may shareholder also arent indication anything ie take two lost value directly releasing red dead redemption even gta drop stock take two release buyer remorse suck id rather buy even id like yeah become ungodly bloated repetitive mediocre content upsetting gone hard path quantity quality try much fail anything substance okay thank saying agree sometimes way much witcher wa great daunting idea go know main dlc hour reason dragon age inquisition wasnt easy compared dragon age origin dragon age think need reduction biglong focus quality ill bring back dragon age origin wa around ish hour inquisition wa like hour completionist solid b hour gap hard hype forand love good world need good im interested environment sometimes actually wish larger played oddyssey wa excited going new area get read research thing saw might done time course never buy full price expecting actually competent story anymore paid im enjoying pretty much feeling large prologue long like hour want go around finding tower assassination mission havent finished yet im looking forward similar valhalla think mirage wa perfect size honestly big dumb colectathons great need chill documentary hr youtube essay played black flag wa huge city huge like ten year old guess like ten twenty time bigger stopped playing black flag tbh wa ready done story seemed take nosedive conclusion got back last time novelty ship sailing black flag whole time wa playing kept feeling resentful whenever made get ship havent back franchise since kind shame really used like became clear abandoning overarching narrative could keep milking franchise forever real plan lost interest origin wa pretty cool traveling egypt wa amazing mean honestly completely get ive said thing reliably expect youll get fun completely forget nothing special part get willing pay full price theyre everything think think good get theyre sale hell hit maybe dollar ill probably fuckin buy le hr entertainment sure seems like good value life short playing mediocre world plenty fantastic also find interesting person would engage something feel average best choice lol yep last bought full price wa siege cant think single since think seemed like wa worth genuinely never understand happily still also cant comprehend still buy cod drove still either deleted old curmudgeon also reporting reminder also price ha actually substantially decreased due inflation easily got buck worth quality time civ bg hot take odyssey first two le controversial id imagine loved mapworld built sailing wa fun enough wa first p arpg felt new different gameplaywise agree usually dont replay year beating first time ill beat ubi buy year two dlcs buck worth understand way everyone oh course odyssey origin good way test buy subscription method make ton sense company lot open world long pretty hard invest much time beating month completely drop afterwards subscription great kind revenue company dont think value much le regular sale fraction subscriber stay service try think theyll consider success considering go straight ubisoft pocket without steam take month finish good thing paying subscription ubisoft crazy ive done never month max paying wa far pragmatic spending isnt terrible without middleman worth noting ubisoft every country live turkey per month ubisoft implementing regional pricing would similar copy sold retailer doesnt matter many retailer actually sell buy amount expect sell ubi get money upfront might bulk deal special deal wa still sold point currently top steam top seller even ahead mh wild veilguard never went beyond top relaxed release schedule think genuinely well profitability depend budget selling well far truly dont understand weird fetish wanting youre interested fail intel smartly pay key wa actually activated thats sponsored deal work used got disc pay lol easier someone forgets use key get save bit money expense even dont care least give friend might since paid end day buying intels product learned shortly picking gaming year ago stay far away forum planned playing anything least well first impression set usually take couple playthroughs still best decision ive ever made ive noticed reviewer well theyll write novel positive ha turn around like va kind suck tho problem content creator tho end day operate profit motif deliberately obscure actual opinion order align think popular get viewer dont trust anymore trust ign something seems like ha much interest genuinely honest way focused aligning perceive popular sentiment stopped taking account opinion deciding buy instead skim commentary long watch gameplay dialogue see pique interest ive found thats far consistent way get gauge good im far satisfied purchase result remember talked buying ghost tsushima internet insisted wa amazing thing ever made wa bored ten hour almost stopped playing clearing first region equally wa told odyssey wa steaming pile garbage bought sale two year launched mostly came remastered ultimate edition ended putting hour multiple playthroughs need realize conforming everyone el opinion lame imagine reality actually felt comfortable offering genuine opinion something instead parroting word word favorite youtuber told theyve never even played mention couple thing didnt like go recommend agree overall scenario could simply also positive mention therefore dont recommend bland even bad lmao wa watching banshee inisherin thinking wa new favorite movie find imdb true also dont think number ever big enough drive success failure many bundle giveaway could thousand largely irrelevant yep mil budget isnt huge large aaa title need million full priced sale break even everyone get cut revenue said dont hit first weekend huge gon na magically materialize especially yearly release isnt gon na relevant year way skyrim cyberpunk witcher special tent pole type company come every year true genuinely make bank sustained tail thats rare relied upon business model man sky ha consistent sale performance built upon devs hard work thats neat part didnt dude lying lol le le trust reported stats figure feel like number release push agenda actually reporting data even stat reporting agency like circana release incomplete strange data never independently check verify told hidden behind curtain journalism around discourse usually dont buy hype anymore sit wait till dust settle especially discourse nothing shitting either liking liking reddit karma veilguard exactly thing journalist also said dragon age veilguard sold well recently learned didnt even reach half expected sale selling well selling well enough make development year two different thing dav reddit trying gaslight everyone selling well good wa absurd thing veilguard player month ha two day already successful veilguard odyssey peaked k steam still sold copy pc isnt bulk playerbase need sell million copy minimum ubisoft survive ubisoft going survive regardless idea genuinely verge existing anymore hilarious show little anyone actually know company work theyll definitely downsize isnt successful hope ubisoft absolutely still exist either way especially since live service life raft siege also ha mtx like valhalla theyre relying pure sale theyre going make substantial amount money shit sell shop likely veilguard sell well quoted journalist usually jason schreier referenced post stephen totilo said million lot sale problem wa development year rebooted twice couldnt sell well way might also suffering similar problem delayed several time every time required sale go wow almost like difference selling well reaching expected sale suppose make sell million copy say later oh expected sell million didnt reach expected sale sure acting like million failure wild tbh act like ubisoft dont deserve hate ubisoft deserve hate even announced lmao could also simply like ubisoft churning open world fetch quest fencesitting rpg element pretend fresh eh lack asian male protagonist definitely issue doubt sincerity talking issue regard nioh wa quite popular wellreceived never saw anyone complaining white male lead feudal japan reason cant figure conversation started protagonist wa black guy whiny hilarious please keep laugh coming give fuck bro catholic didnt cry like bitch made fist fight pope ruining history culture prime minister japan issue wa allowing player destroy religious site afraid tourist take issue said nothing hilarious watch gamers defend gov censoring causing violence use make fun nonsense lol reception facebook gross bunch fat dork keep insisting everyone japan mad fuck lmao wa perfect brain setting wa perfection loved seeing blue water ha great far hasnt fully brain im genuinely enjoying challenge stealth gameplay setting also great especially dynamic weather kick could get odyssey done origin death except weird regional boss need try might burned bought valhalla spring sale also despised map system ive every prior even smaller like rogue v black flag hour valhalla map system gave silver light bigger silver light yellow light bigger yellow light hell doe even mean spending minute trying find big yellow light find gold like respect time couldnt handle uncertainty whether pov wa worth interest wa mindlessness playthrough put didnt respect time worth valhalla stopped playing look like crap look visually appealing system place monotonous mostly unchanged year highly limited free roam enemy area walking god level incredibly boring make hyper linear open world combat look terrible animation aside protagonist wooden dialogue bone dry mtx shop reminiscent mobile garbage egregious sin modern aaa gaming dogshit plot dialogue dont know theyre hiring within like watching movie something fuck sake youre dropping hundred million dev ad go hollywood pay screenwriter great resume hundred thousand need work promise loved last kingdom probably connected valhalla feel like big disconnect professional reviewer gamers day series use different weapon amount weapon combo immense different style move combo everything switch hand fly change even repetitive ghost ha many combat entire yet complains combat thats bad reason enjoy im sure mirage wa good wasnt major entry series wa valhalla spinoff title said main entry imo black flag wa great good dont think beat brotherhood tbh argue want think black flag ha best ending medium past year scene friend around table saying farewell literally sailing sunset beautiful voice band parting glass perfect yet got similar number instead league difference havent played since black flag doe mean would assassination instant kill like keep fighting target stab neck didnt know complained found building assassination damage fun time odyssey eventually go full glass cannon shot everything theyve toggle last four fair every single rpg ha toggle except maybe origin minute since played im certain ever added option sure wa odyssey valhalla must blind cant see toggle yeah really like perk playing get shes ninja mean storyline general someone else said really kick last hour theyve part brotherhood since none goal rather personal usually revenge writer clumsily try put goal direction even bother majority revenge plot nothing templar tbf thats like half story series fuck well redeeming factor ubisoft go sale soon try miss stealth doubt would male wa wa evie jacob got played didnt choice cheer answering yeah im shitting completely honestly anything stand alone right would like fly shit think wa always massive fanboy old series got midnight launch ect new style isnt really scratching itch speak kind wish would separate keep awesome historical setting story time restart start revamp sort story actually good though origin nd rd favourite behind loved devs clearly put lot effort passion despite newgen like origin like usual loweffort set world building origin incredible dont think match term giving glimpse ancient world wa like well according every thread epic willing buy hit steam telling whining baby tiny minority almost like player count pretty stupid metric determine success singleplayer lol dont think budget sh wa remake even remotely comparable issue controversy though dont know exactly budget wa hard know many unit need sold profitable said budget wa probably pretty high given big ubisoft either way would expect need sell several million copy break even yeah doesnt support ubisoft bad idea wrong doesnt count duh also valhalla peaked around something k turned best selling ever something like also probably negatively reviewed least popular sentiment like odyssey valhalla misrepresentation launched steam two year console epic sure odyssey oh yeah compare best decade bad shit thats crazy bg didnt launch simultaneously console also bg really fair comparison isnt going revolutionize genre yet every new release successful last ubisoft step closer bankruptcy make sense theyve always like even first ha ton highly repetitive content every city wa rather short kept story got feeling hour recently played unity far cry dont know ubi ive never felt feeling maybe hour prologue im huge fan anything think theyve done great job keeping similar last rather drastic change valhalla literally bored point couldnt finish entire basically mission different area map best x amount hr content dont want put end wa like kept playing perfect length anywhere hour even crazy amount time think last played broke wa baldurs gate rare exception though think prior wa red dead cant imagine playing ubisoft bloatware long would absolutely love set japan like dont even problem paying wouldnt mind long allows pause good rather big sake big nbsp total war ha short campaign ever long need plan ahead time nbsp played row factor together different playing hour nbsp online used moment bootee deviced stop hour time big year last year wa cyberpunk witcher rdr year kcd every time contemplate realize going hundred hour bloat padding cant bring waste precious gaming time something thats finest im playing xenoblade great mean eventually mechanic get really repetitive either lose whole lot storyside quest rush main story slog battle music exception battle mechanic side quest drop wait month come back forgotten character big emotional story beat really feel like lose lose odyssey wa wonderful sweet spot fun combat everything wa beautiful lot fillery quest couple way next fun fort bounty got hour valhalla realized wa bored tear halfway region stopped never looked back lol hr open whatever guess like thing time really liked especially afterlife stuffi le le trust reported stats figure feel like number release push agenda actually reporting data thats literally always case friend company dont release kind information satisfy folk passing curiosity release entice new investor portray product desirable consumer reason company ever doe anything push agenda seeing bunch tea leaf reading sale number last thing care buying plenty good dont sell plenty bad get sale deserve sale number indicative quality buy want reason reddit even gaming journalist seen respectable reason tried gaslight believing sold well live service life raft thats fucking gold homie made laugh ubis headcount nutty tho roughly k staff across studio thats lot take pull significantly revenue hope avoid drastic cut wouldnt surprised happen deleted cost million worth sale make million sale would complete failure bizarre defensive white american japanese culture realistically dont actually care shield defend criticism racist take meanwhile ubisoft shit american history none gave fuck lol absolute opinion odyssey think wa could properly turn brain relaxing odyssey interesting happens setting also great especially dynamic weather kick love build get storm hear wind thunder far see umbrella half minute later torrential thats area improves map pretty much empty start viewpoint put question mark map thats either come across thing get rumour random encounter longer climb viewpoint get side quest chest marked map clean honestly make want explore never

veilguard starfield literally rated higuer lmao stellar blade like metacritic reddit cant stop slobbering tbf doe big titty anime waifu appeal huge gooner crowd probably unpopular gaming related opinion similar said slapped ubisoft logo ghost tsushima would definitely considered mid ubisoft type open world dont even dislike actually really enjoyed part although really hard time fully understanding overwhelming praise especially reddit much felt tired ripped straight ubisoft formula seems ubisoft slop since anyone take review aaa seriously always hype aaa didnt wouldnt get interview preview material trip check gaming journalism isnt objective way forever got wa also open world slop though competent slop nonetheless yeah especially someone like ubisoft may withhold review copy next release also literally envelope rather oh blorbo quest guess dont want early press release blorbo quest mean review released good day later reviewer gave blorbo quest user score real review considering many wind getting review bombed hour release true critic review score inflated bad ive seen review praise vielguard return form ive seen review praise civ return form usual ill reserve judgment come player get hand prerelease review joke objectively largest budget flop videogame history top head recall got full recall refund entitled subjective opinion wa good player considered bad worth time money failed quickly rare concord player superman reference perfect explained gave score though loved world gameplay also didnt bash story say could better story absolutely dogshit destroys previous estabilshed lore character unlikeable hey quite fun gameplay graphic arent n level average reviewer veilguard assume yeah see look leap bound better valhalla ill fully admit im die hard hated vahalla thought still beat dlc playthrough though yes weather system im also super hard stealth mode announced im possibly rdr lot mission focused type combat dont recall mission wa direct copypaste scenario certainly nothing akin clear bandit camp formula thats common open world title said agree repeating mission common necessarily indicative bad favourite open world title included form repetition ghostwire tokyo exactly reviewer need take account dont speed blitz put review embargo day got platinumd hour way worse like plus sync tower castle enemy like shrine run around aimlessly without fighting either collect scroll pray shrine feel like want long possible youre likely spend money speed thing buy cosmetic ive played open world like kcd elden ring cyberpunk etc least variety hidden thing find found exploring boring watched episode naruto season invincible marvel movie nd monitor went around map everything might love want good background waste time multi task might right yeah kingdom come deliverance ha issue quest still blast elden ring doesnt objective free go anywhere want point majority want someone tell already think someone say different opinion theyre shill paid actor someone say think theyre clearly unbiased upholding highest standard journalism mortismal skillup especially latter give clear specific example making point appreciated compared tell dont show approach many reviewer unless know fact taste overlap much given reviewer case thats mortismal im going take word unless give specific justification opinion return form mean nothing show medescribe specific instance character show real depth get make impactful decision obviously thats hard balance spoiling well good job usually hard watch youtubers generally taste bring good point fair quality critique twitch also good way wrap head around offer old believe news outlet incentivised give good review big franchise see almost every turd released would go youtube watch commentary gameplay need comment whoooa next big thing moment let see eye feel okay good decide never ever trust number critic gave concord starfield never trust trust whoevers review fit narrative like reddit paid hotel flight also included ofc biggest star war fan yt channel also got offer declined wa shit wanted able call instead lying fan becomes end yeah couple watched said good amount content weekly mission maybe daily stuff ask ng youtubers get paid make sense idea reviewer large website seems different luke stephen usually like dunk thing ha milked ubisoft going shit make fun valhalla every min seems liked specifically different usual think ubisoft openworld everyone still polished fun waiting next major release unfortunately ubisoft got kcd split fiction even avowed next clair obscur doom mafia gta vi might get crushed due comparison alone certain someone recording video kcd v right second hifi rush got glowing review player sold bad microsoft sold studio wa fan odyssey origin mirage wa koo valhalla pretty much delisted lol appreciate probably wait till go sale real impressive like hour turn bit slog sound like valhalla wa even bloated setting kassandra best protagonist since lol yes thought tsushima setting would enough beautiful vibrant place exist wa time halfway simply enough slog mediocre repetitive gameplay wa thinking thing im mindset ill wait month go sale like every ubi itll worth get bored halfway quit true majesty world really something artistic impressive even tho gameplay wa terribly flat repetitive infinite screenshots await ubi curate vr historic field trip wa rich historical information thought odyssey wa anything mediocre good story good writing good world good combat good everything everything odyssey wa good addicting absorbing story kinda fizzled partstoo long thought gameplay location incredible never got bored start finish shepard shadowheart odyssey wasnt title would much higher rated opinion chaire friend got backup origin odyssey best story wise since black flag hear forced grinding trying strong arm buying microtransactions dont like valhalla odyssey odyssey third fav ii origin ha great overall narrative terrible story practically ha nothing overall series first dlc darius persian yea feeling slogs odyssey wa easier digest since big reader peloponnesian war greek mythology work homer plato honest wa absolutely gorgeous seeing thing like hot gate agora athens statue zeus olympia glory gave warm fuzzies history nerd want go issue valhalla wa combat wa absolutely atrocious worst series ha far valhalla wa huge friend wa hour still nowhere near clearing question mark map yeah bloat wa insane also found progression skill weapon world uninteresting loved valhalla thought wa getting close end wa like halfway origin odyssey nice although latter already felt bloated towards end valhalla wa much feel like depends like setting thought origin odyssey bloated boring realized hate setting valhalla hand enjoyed far far also love period england couldnt get enough wa sad wa finished also didnt marathon took year beat dlc since released dlc nearly year took time enjoyed every second cant say origin odyssey dont care greek mythology ancient egypt origin wa peak rest felt bloated put personally way issue playing odyssey valhalla maybe played valhalla first fun really like viking setting though feel like valhalla story wa pretty decent lenght absolutely public expectation ha large role review score mention name studio publisher good point become jaded aware lot aaa property devolved blatant cash grab nothing show looking dragon age solid number like even positive nowadays already seeing hardcore fanboys whine bought dare enjoy theyve decided hate lol bruh made deathstroke fight tank yeah agree went maybe best application multiple possible protagonist ever something completely forced uninspired wasnt premise male eivor wa actually odin female eivor wa viking animus couldnt tell dna apart yeah agree went maybe best application multiple possible protagonist ever something completely forced uninspired least theyre lot le repetitive valhalla wa go table go new area quest go back table origin main story like hour odyssey thats pretty much standard rpgs confirmed middle hour according th review blurb tom phillips eurogamer free continuing character modern day storyline way dont think average considered okay also grifter spend month attacking something contradict constantly isnt awful reach pretty good scorelike theyll call general audience sheep liking theyll disengage wa bg level masterpiece except youre demanding better ha played week steer clear comment section regarding naughty dog next unreal toxicity minute trailer conjure miserable good news lot love enjoys videogames doom gloom found avowed really repetitive boring honestly hate scoring system get rid numerical score write review worth reading short circuit conversation thats gaming rating work gaming median anything considered bad actually good get least review actually saying alright franchise past prime time complaint syndicate two protagonist werent different enough didnt matter played opposite problem seems winning twoprotagonist formula introducing main character cant parkour title immediate non starter like shouldnt gotten past pre alpha unpopular opinion indeed get youre saying insomniac spiderman already pretty much without extra hour bloat ubisoft tend side content quite literally task copy pasted around map lesser degree ubisoft doe feel like youre asking longer right encapsulates point perfectly lmao felt way starfield ive known thought wa almost like review opinion opinion arent absolute truth im talking reliable review im commenting obvious double standard different meta score perceived shouldt sentiment similar similarlyreviewed big review reliability get diluted pool gon na hard argue review le reliable gots steam review also garbage nah combat especially art direction mile ahead anything ubisoft ha put story nothing special ill give cutscenes still far better ubisoft manage ubisoft beat got npc density actual city deleted constantly remind got wasnt ubisoft cause reddit like get good score see told masterpiece like get bad score take review even serious paid shill real gamers work also disliked way around review piece art subjective nature thing objective review every review every aaa good give aaa bad review doe slop mean context got gave new ability enemy got harder scaled end side quest awesome dont know else could open world wouldnt make slop opinion also ha knock effect filtering honest reviewer release day hype ensuring day review broadly positive true also applicable every case drama get review bombed tho normalise release still trust user review critic everyday week absolute floor critic give aaa even actual turd thing either great awful lot inbetween like others said charging thats alright sea good great free choice said thought wa worth time money dont even think knew wa even closed wa apathy bad good essentially everyone played said wa ok solid gameplay loop problem wanted yet another hero shooter theyre free decent isnt good enough also marketing wa pretty bad ive never top competitive player world respect guy haha clarify played beta pay gameranx utube said wonderful world really boring storychars wan na extend comment bit well red dead mission design diverse hold hand highly scripted mission allow zero divergence path mandated rockstar granted mission extremely well crafted acted designed much criticism repetition get meat bone simplify mission still reduced go shoot guy watch minute cutscenes personally dont mind simplified somewhat repetitive mission objective long proper sandbox tool create dynamic diverse solution problem environment well designed creating spontaneous diversion player think figured rockstar mission design generally restrictive want thing walk way freedom try anything else combat another weak point basic every encounter exact way id rather mission type approached multiple way agree kcd way qualitative content open world open world opinion wa repetition got stale ultimately better regard great point love clear example review saw review star war outlaw small channel guy gave many extraordinarily detailed example exactly gameplay wa poor dumbed v every ubisoft nailed showing rather giving opinion close smell everyones hated past ive loved different put hr valhalla didnt end finishing world gameplay wa captivating enough much investment wanted ran raid like hr probably fun story really great dramatic moment like hour apart dont really feel worthwhile hate say britain wa godawful boring ride egypt greece much better much prettier go opinion closer scope originsodyssey ill pretty happy especially combat better valhalla well another sore spot viking isnt really want valhalla wa much le bloated took forever clear map odyssey tho wa fun valhalla took much le time complete partly didnt lot open ocean travel malaka didnt realize wa missing first picked went alexios dropped fairly early start kassandra playthrough year two later got hooked nah bayek would say ha strong case best say complete acezio fanboy bayek erasure right kassandra good bayek damn good black flag moment yeah odyssey wa great fun thats right fun shoker haha ha never historically accurate ha always felt like scifi writing shouldnt taken seriously studio odyssey ubisoft quebec much feel like hour lot polished term detail certainly feel like honestly thats b tiny percentage side activity progress odyssey different open world rpg completed maybe world didnt even visit region wa still grossly overleveled end odyssey wa much mechanically sound valhalla imo combat wa satisfying looting gear system maybe teensy bit excessive wa fun hell mess around exploration world super engaging everything felt intentional many experience set sail go main quest find side tracked random little island end spending next two three hour playtime wrapped big multi part side quest line wa completely intertwined main story time wa looked journal scratched head completely forgotten wasnt main quest first place made sailing around sea sooooo much fun every new area wa exciting get first time think ever played odyssey hurt lot rush story ignore everything else much outside main quest dont experience everything may feel little shallow genuinely favorite rpgs favorite period really ever valhalla stripped back made odyssey special replaced giant repetitive slog last waaaaaaay long many mechanic design choice completely stripped left felt completely soulless first ten twenty hour fun realize gameplay loop isnt going really change meaningful way still hour go frustrating step backwards plus world painfully dull comparison odyssey really feel like stepping back time giant expansive world wa littered secret story god damn character odyssey got back series valhalla wa decent didnt enjoy much im pretty sure ill check point dodge mechanic wa broken could literally beat enemy level higher lol exactly beautiful world soon start engaging combat feel cheap uninspired suspect veilguard actually good wrong title im lazy find know comment section mess also funny ha shitting valhala concord starfield etc nonstop easily could shit got viral video also watching kinda funny review rn think great think meh think decent think land dont mind new system tho tbh odyssey wa interesting idea two character style fine didnt ply think syndicate honestly time modern day bit always standout worst part every coming twenty year took long enough mixed feeling scifi element franchise ive hated modernday stuff part would thing original built towards conclusion eliminated ancient history part entirely least playing fullfledged desmond mile parkouring across sprawling dystopian cityscape would made whole animus thing feel like kind payoff didnt get make presentday stuff feel pointless least appreciate little intruded experience odyssey havent finished yet ive stepped animus liketwice hour almost apologetic like oh sorry contractually obligated include stuff else cant legally call going pause adventure five minute well back ancient greece time interesting thats insane theyve abandoned whole present timeline like good way never really liked insane pretty much went yeha thing weve every working get rid starfield also mostly review fool trust gamejournos time even masterpiece would claim astroturfing bought critic mass example tlou comment wa replying response wa reference state gaming whole specifically theyre saying matter gamers upset insinuating get upset sake upset rather legitimate reason want talk franchise ubisoft whole safe say could whole lot better earned stinky reputation anticonsumer practice generally uninspired gameplay however opportunity turn around sake passionate devs know exist ubisoft hope theyve flipped new leaf cooked something truly special time wont holding breath never understand mad post something negative every month year tlou almost year old still obsessed negative way dislike something ill move something like life short angry thing love constantly bad thought make depressive time genuinly hyped tough new ip sequel remake remaster new ip protagonist female makeup fan spreading vitriol cry woke good amazing otherwise id agree thats work sure whatever absolutely squeezing possible positive review degree scale varying degree trash terrible decision really good good fine meh suck suck suck suck suck suck absurdly pessimistic scale stick old rule anything pretty much either full bug half finished usually mean bit innovation charm dragged much bad straight averagegood goodgreat great genre defining reminder concord dustborn got ign veilguard got definitely median mean metastatic isnt good indicator quality problem critic score referencing especially recent year big departure actual community sentiment ghost tsushima use rating gave avg starfield ha user avg seem way accurate community perception opposed critic rating pointed factoring part ubisoft ha lost good consumer base whole release cycle fair expectation critic average theyre big publisher score likely going come fairly narrow range fear damaging essential business relationship agree absolutely gasping confirmation narrative theyve already set though theyll probably get anyway clearly getting sick ubisoft showing sale double standard shit metacritic everyone say feel way better two score plain wrong super casual gamer probably represents typical consumer steam review maybe metric reference im deciding buy steam review least accurate pretend want aggregate score given far accurate whatever reviewer watch consensus even reddit veilguard starfield bad wukong got good correct according steam combat dodge roll counter like rpg ever stance counter different enemy class encounter needed cut amount fox den like rd believe thats every new interesting feature included good wa followed bog standard open world fare weve seen dozen time point question mark boring side quest enemy base clear endless collectible would argue review technical aspect objective important doe crash ha gamebreaking bug yeah course piece art also something interact broken eh loved got isnt great hill die fight enemy throughout entire iki island excluded think enemy swap stance interesting get health damage completely gone highest difficulty act wa amazing act wa quite similar act still continued act honestly thought whole area wa act area got repetitive wa done long end came side quest predictable least quite repetitive also boiled go place kill enemy listen npc talk quest done wouldve middling without excellent atmosphere yes agree havent finished rdr far almost mission ride horse walk listening dialogue cutscene shoot ride hose walk listening dialogue break probably spend like third entire time listening anything also problematic every shootout exact strategy tool use try various thing honestly boring quite fast rockstar make beautiful open world insane production value mission structure gameplay seems like afterthought quite lacking yep fully agree valhalla wa definitely better stand alone tho wanted love valhalla love setting detail everything except begin blend together never finished went back time cant far feel like odyssey japan think thats god thing world vibrant beautiful combat lot like odyssey valhalla odyssey guilty pleasure lol loved got dlcs haha good ha potential good dlcs luckily googled better result basically pick kassandra shes basically actual protagonist alexios dont want woman lol bayek favorite protagonist series ka best love odyssey nailed exactly experience odyssey loved big plot point led pretty devastating personal outcome main character wa like fuck plot im going roam sea find thats think cassandra would juncture merrily sailed found embroiled guerrilla movement love triangle first island getaway ended _horribly_ choice made across intertwined quest chain great start thing tracking mysterious origin finding exciting plot relevant precursor shit wa still totally optional another island sabbatical crete tried go _right way_ helping local also steering clear romance without devastating fuckup heartbreaking revelation finally catharsis sea faring sabbatical wa cassandra actually saved day could go back plot let piece together side quest mini arc full fun emotional mini story dont think ive ever invested story arc _ive_ pieced together video character personally didnt find loot gear system odyssey bloated loved mean sure wa trash sold thats got money rest made cool outfit system found assassination extra rewarding wa reason go camp fortress quietly get rid soldiersto see improve character better equipment strange valhalla doesnt system imagine focused viking absolutely zero loot make raiding rewarding probably biggest reason didnt im going viking want damn viking let raid loot like odyssey setting valhalla wa bland boring make good big structure statue anything interesting run shack church wa polar opposite odyssey origin logic every soul broken beat lvl though syndicate degree skill tree shared weapon difference upgrade available character etc yes wa actually fun syndicate wa underrated feel london wa lovingly recreated combat wa fun yeah jacob wa brawler evie wa stealthytricky mission made switch part could switch easily black flag fantastic favourite word hate pulled pirate fantasy forced walk around office bg level masterpiece mean absolutely widespread critic regular consumer across board mean fair gamers love getting upset sake upset fact complaining color yasukes skin actual gameplay pretty good sign agree confusing fuck especially new gaming basically academic scale c b perfect close anything different degree sucking shouldnt way thats work dont think much issue scale rather receive rating mostly due financial time investment required engage video hour indie get still consider worth picking hand hour aaa rpg getting seen much negatively price also want spend hour playing isnt incredible except review bombed stupid reason seems ripe considering previous discourse even pure product review fairly subjective sure could list every bug encountered much little bug negatively affected experience still going highly subjective would also argue functional review le important day every ha day patch hard know many bug review copy end final product rest u tbh ive never really understood got wa revered honestly thought wa better put together ubisoft sense combat wa average since wa mostly hammer scissors paper use stance opponent weak thats deep got never understood much praise got stealth wa surface level pretty buggy sense wa heavily memed release best part wa story used wind instead compass truly dont understand wa got winner contender cant remember maybe wa slow year havent played literally since every time watch new realise im missing anything played got wa thinking well least wont feel liie playing another open world check list awhile never understand open world check list get much praise linear tighter thoughtout experience well yeah highest difficulty hit death example perfect open world youre looking example perfect open world youre looking legit question loved hour w dlc fuck basim modern day shit wa intriguing modern day shit ha make special unfortunate wont get new md story still gon na fun well theyre practically character kassandra ha amazing va absolutely nail role like giving gary oldman mediocre script hell make feel like good script good interesting talk immersing nailed much odyssey get didnt vibe felt like adventure really start odyssey bought year ago euro something never played someone played many paid attention latter announcement valhalla design wa partly influenced ubisoft toning rpg element due backlash odyssey much rpg instead imo valhalla doe feel le grindy odyssey odyssey overall better wa valhalla didnt bother dlc content finishing main story need skill soul dodge window incredibly forgiving valhalla every walk life love getting upset sake group hating black man another group hating something like space marine woman simply nothing better complain comment said ubisoft whole much earned foul reputation recent release suffered term quality especially monetization hopefully prove turning point say form early look least visuals stunning rdr easy answer never know might eventually yeah really feel immersed ill buy shit say thing absolutely feel like great big adventure id put witcher action rpg space term greatness hey least give go doesnt click doesnt click doe hour pure fun exploration best played valhalla h maybe got bored odyssey wa beautiful nice atmosphere enjoyed lot fully realise thats likely made change thats thing ubisoft say amd seems apply ubisoft equally well never miss opportunity miss opportunity viking time tone rpg element absolutely viking without loot system open world already ha raiding system thats viking anymore like example small enemy camp valhalla map dont chest anything theyre assassinatekill enemy inside chest cant get ingot enemy dont loot anything whats point viking killing enemy doesnt reward feel soulless given hope lol

developer elder scroll online wa shortfall term experience compared skyrim morrowwind honestly found fable iii get put kinda best friend spent hour wandering around albion generally great time even story please dont hang plus give fable way enemy beat buuuuut wait actually liked part alot wa twist didnt fully expect figured wa foreshadowing fable wa actually going attack later fable wa ok magic wa op played bit fable next combat seemed lot balanced agreed sooner learn peter megapixel big talkin show letdown sooner see garbage horizon isnt totally agree got first week man wa mistake true think halo moving cod model word bland forgettable gameplay focused multiplayer didnt hype saw trailer said get make alien build civilization car building go space wa cool basic cool like personally artistic barely tool use make decent looking stuff channel idea different alien archtypes culture warrior alien would building bulky metal spike car big gun scientist would smooth scifi aesthetic gun looked fancy wa good using adventure creator would make planet ala good adventure creator spore wa far ahead time im sure recreated could prolly pull wa ambitious maybe even still well maxi pushing old new box simcity another sims hope give spore love duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude love longterm strategic decision turnbase immidiate decision battle dx ported shogun tweaked ai nerfed archer spam applied rome map would happy pay op opinion skyrim wa way handholdy could turn arrow cant find morrowind told go bridge follow path follow river found temple vivec quest youd get closer youd find npc would give specification direction quest issue marking map whole map already explored seems silly skyrim wa first elder scroll played oblivion first oblivion gate whooped specifically tower good thing wa level system hate voted story wa shit wasnt finished everything ward wa kinda boring fable isnt nearly bad fable however wa gigantic let fable especially get many breaking glitch render file complete utterly useless make question bothered mediocre first place get used downvoted like hahaha xd thought gameplay wa fun realistic bullet damage mostly melee combat wa really satisfying wa good wasnt changer like godeneye upvote right wa expecting next great experience feel like promised far much could deliver time gta v give damn fine advertising pr dept launch launched many post launch promise got pushed way back example promised heist within week launch ha nearly half year story good though dont like much gta iv personally wa real drama gta iv actually cared character unlike gta v everyone except trevor died really wouldnt care spent hour evening online bunch randomers ill never see trying drive supercar massive trialslike hill online insanely good dont wa buggy long really missing blast campaign suck control broken ai cheap soundtrack horrible online suck map design isnt impressive sony clearly phoned thats wa indeed pretty boring everything else remake port p remake steam p remake didnt anything know fully understand gave u forewarning initially heard elder scroll online developed idea skyrim multiplayer remember meeting twothree dog guy went outside wa going fast travel soon autosaved wa low hp happened like bandit something would keep instagibbing due locked combat soon loaded last save wa like hour two back never motivation redo part done may give gaming pc get mod afterall many rather first yeah choice really change last level look thats npc might behave little differently le ratsweepers enough effectively matter really biggest thing dont like mana doesnt recharge im talking blink wait recharges blink dark sight thing use dont permanently take away mana given power thing pretty big mechanic youd think theyd make use time without use potion im saying full recharge maybe halfway charged minute stop recharging something feel like wa developed combat mind stealth aspect wa added almost last minute played year came controlswere clunky hell wa really average shooter albeit good sense atmosphere seeing revolves around basically running away set survival horror environment make sense disagree shattered dimension amazing spiderman shattered dimension functional youre playing spiderman feel like spiderman think fails rather standard action spiderman draped top amazing spidermans swinging look okay since youre holding button pushing forward make swinging feel pointless first place swinging isnt going make feel like spiderman even spidey may well drive car would way hold go button steer spidey ive played since spiderman think op safe skipping dev say still working update ha released anything forever check rcubeworld hate woolay dont know though honestly probably shouldve waited longer release alpha postponed beta release loved fc didnt finish fc clearing entire first map getting final mission region find glitch breaking bug made couldnt get mission open next portion release patch start beginning patch whose save file wa already bugged collecting literally everything first area seems tedious get tired fc couple hour try playing still though awesome feature thing missed apart choosing character mean really fcs protagonist wa frickin frat bro got magical tribal tattoo ffs wa buddy system chance die even everything right made seem lot intense gave sense reality couldnt control everything youre right spawn rate wa unforgiving always bugged wa middle massive civil war person soldier ever shot wa civilian sight gunfight opposing faction world felt kinda lifeless incase didnt know elder scroll online wa developed zenimax bethesda going hang frankly supplementing opinion spore glad someone enjoyed pretty sure referring fact twitch shooter like cod tactical shooter like battlefield yes titanfall design twitch shooter similar map design like cod map another scaled laid reaction oriented much like cod wa boat picked brand new computer integrated graphic nothing compared current rig hadnt kept gaming news simply couldnt run whatever discussing knew nothing spore except design creature shape penis ended really fun common critcism doesnt bug would like see changed anyway im glad critcism common maybe bethesda work mind create happy medium understand need create accesible majority atmospheric way reason didnt bother map marker imo used radiant quest much got lazy dont give map marker random location sure set like companion quest least tell dungeon stuff northwest whiterun follow road west turn north first turning drive little crazy fully understand many wouldnt enjoy morrowinds cryptic bit dialog even cryptic paragraph journal interpreting cryptic bit dialog made exploration really immersed world story knew general direction maybe part town wa lucky wasnt psychic like everyone skyrim constantly checking foursquare know exactly see thats disliked morrowind couldnt find shit gave even finished rd quest wa kept playing completion storyline anything like wanted lap character sphere grid sooooo addictive fanboys honestly never ran ending glitch fable even though played time year saying arent dont know classified numerous said fable still far best franchise stupid thats presented valid opinion went dont agree ill downvote reason yeah wa huge step uncharteds gameplay intense multiplayer amazing agreed multiplayer part personally liked story immensely occupied long gta v multiplayer wa nothing delayed update rockstar prioritizing patching fun glitch exploit like lawn mower garage instead adding feature wereand still waiting couldnt disagree character remember gta iv niko fucking roman remembered packie turned v remember playing like fun story quite shit didnt care niko really anyone gta v hand franklin deepest character whole gta franchise opinion cj lazlo id say michael character nailed year old dude going midlife crisis trevor wa pretty good cared story related despised loved michael family time lemar funniest character ive seen loooong time devin weston scream im annoying prick side mission guy like beverly beat iv gta iv win ragdollscar damage driving also doesnt kifflom mission fuck mission liked trevor little comment even ran fox something made giggle well understand assumption multiplayer skyrim would cool dont think call downside developer clearly stated location well release thats fault far throwback morrowind except great graphic soso multiplayer part main quest hate simple fact feel pushed example go metro get dog even though reality would possible climb rubble saving time completely avoiding dark underground thing really like fact ghoul mask quest first decent amount tunnel arent threat anymore yeah mana meter really nerfed experience made alot using blink dark sight rat slow time might cool used fightwhich much know stealth first whemever tried run around killing bitch id last minute max maybe wasnt leveled enough tall boysassassinsorgan grinder dude would destroy wooooosh since upvoted ill assume comment need explained wa sarcastic joke revolves around basically running away exactly made cm complete failure dev irony making franchise previous failed dramatically basing primary mechanic around fighting back exactly cm beat also make comment hilariously funny thread agree still enjoyed spidey centric story wa center shattered dimension youre right amazing long since able swing around like ended quite enjoying oh thought worked along side create eso fine im big kid turn even option thats lazy see different despite annoying occurrence gta iv character calling thought ending related somewhat linear still decision involved lot weight personally gta vfranklin kind annoyed seemed like extremely unnecessary third wheel attached michael trevors situation throughout whole michael trevor well written respective role though find michael family terrible whole unworthy ha given franklin problem pretty much normally revolve around friend hood try use cant even see get repetitive annoying thats see youre coming pretty clearly though different preference others wa announced beforehand doesnt mean enjoy designed way possible kill normally use magic kill blink behind jumpblink back assassinate deleted kinda zenimax developed designed entire bethesda wa simply help lore perspective zenimax might need help bethesda ha working e lore quite time understandable would know better zenimax disclaimer im sure true remember reading old article im sure safe say however wa probably zenimax made big decision sound character clashed go show well made dislike way much like real understand

trailer thats something coming release official reveal trailer story based grounded whatever hey hey hey hey thats insult fp look better disney abortion thats low bar tbf first half stalker trailer thought might new metro lol thought wrapped stuff exodus dragon age looked like cinematic announcing new season cheap fp moba know anything yet real rpg disappointed direction dragon age taking last year correct blizzard activision reason call duty diablo xbox showcase microsoft owns activision blizzard guess mean fallout oblivion remakeremaster thats long rumoured isnt happening wouldnt count elder scroll least four five year away fallout even microsoft probably recognizes need release something singleplayer franchise interim maybe maybe probably wa edge seat seen fallout see november th trailer looked amazing deleted gameplay shown concerning le yes given take year make day know playground basically started working right pandemic add say let take time need get right new fable long entirely new dev team need stick landing look fucking fun straight see new take long make cyberpunk wa teased like year coming elder scroll like yeah im def hungry wolf among u really hope come fruition sure mixtape personally man look cool hell gear look fun cant wait yeah wa really hoping hear something today merger closed like month ago taking age never microsoft shareholder would riot microsoft spending billion buy activision blizzard immediately destroying activision blizzard profitability throwing product money losing heavily subsidized gamepass subscription love art style general doe seem like cup teai feel like itll hollow experience mostly hanging nostalgia music thats thing love showcase id determine wa worth buying im spoiled im nodding head knowing ill get soon launch every showed wa interesting enough least check experience much bitch microsoft gamepass best deal gaming right many many coming usually ton perk league legend champion free etc easily best sub company still updating check note six year old im ok taking ready ready approach keep good devs good thing im happy wait ready wa pretty disappointing even getting release year especially since first trailer came year ago yep even cod way know called fable naming scheme gaming industry taken need name exact name attach date end fable fable fable battlefront battlefront battlefront battlefront sequelreboot definitely remake cant afford right flight simulator vr headset look awesome hopefully gear e day co op expedition wa show isnt filler never scroll way far find south midnight mention look interesting af cant think anything quite like market hope actual combat interesting wa shown doesnt look terrible doesnt stand whole lot either likely end playstation even originally exclusive look official video channel doom said xboxpc go official trailer also includes steamps im guessing majority lol feeling good amount multiplat honestly series cheap point may well get even little gamepass machine lol em pc aswell suggest get gamepass take shot every time someone say word woke dragon age looked like marvel movie script swear wa waiting record scratch someone narrating well thats got doom black ops coming playstation first party output course like dragon age third party also multiplatform story made devs made stray know highly recommend looking skyblivion mod little year away point expectedly might change look phenomenal end good look wont need todd howard remake skyblivion probably end better oblivion already kind perfect pc mod basically remade already point e truly need remake daggerfall arena imo someone correct im wrong understand wow new expansion tied console havent heard wow coming console besides want avvowed speak slightly confidently first person action rpg set world pillar eternity need knowledge world help context look conceptually type skyrimoblivion sword bow magic distinctly starting look brighter color wise like skyrim unfortunately xbox showcase showed looking relatively different gameplay trailer year ago showed could red flag hopefully scratch elder scroll itch lot u waiting e hope helped p yes avatar came earlier year called avatar frontier pandora official graphic xbox made lol like year away min man starfield dropped le year ago prequel maybe theyre callback tbh nice seeing old title got ta replay trilogy dying shit wa announced shown ago look promising vulome yow direction vegetable sophisticated quicksand unite paint cover fearless pet telephone pandora box wuv woo barkbarkbarkbarkbark bear army ha come sound like blast im jealous family gaming like yes havent dipped foot next gen console yet read cod crossplatform since dont see sony making exclusive anytime soon think xbox better deal could get xbox x month instead shelling full cost p plus pay year playstation online full cost lastly mac home office thing miss computer gaming age mythology going scratch big itch guess decide right time know xbox thinking pro model im sure coming year yet mean isnt coming pas trying fight argue curious cause look interesting dont remember seeing mention something wont gamepass team thats amazing job age empire definitely want remake sequel black white wa cool god mechanic creature training know post said probably wouldnt get made way method creature punishment wouldnt mind changed bit would fast getting marcus fenix collection gear heck throw judgment even arent big fan cause ill still judgment really would love replay gear trilogy including dlc campaign upgraded graphic k fps microsoft ha inconsistent past gaming generation halo would give favour microsoft forgets altogether first xbox pas pc still missing though uh excuse halo good uh master chief uh craziest part calling halo shit campaign wasnt exactly wa advertised multiplayer wa great honestly solo playtime multiplayer halo every wa pretty reliant friend war zone wa top tier every old title gamepass iirc xbox series x playable might crazy think eday might come sooner say steam page already min spec requirement dont till month launch think well see sometime next year coalition aint even though gear wa somewhat divided release played barely technical issue though think bought year release story begin wa different cause dont usually remember shit immediately connected felt similar first trailer thats necessarily bad thing oh man riot even ha ben starr ff sound lol funny say main character voiced voice actor va clive rosfield protagonist ff ah shit ive looking new turn based im fan turn based looked good thats great band saudi arabia egypt got big hit flight right parrrrrrty thats prog band said heavy metal deathcore n shit started playing stalker first time supposed getting killed much also im still really early seems like keep failing quest whenever help someone win shootout everyone get killed fail normal andrew hullshult master craft trust yeah way hasnt completely scrapped redone point must hellscape silksong karlson anticipated silencelack communication dev never coming silksong subreddit legitimately going hollow like elden ring partially agree bit ridiculous devs havent said anything long time like simple statement saying theyre still working would go long way laugh halflife weve lot highly anticipated sucked major longer wait stressedout get silksong point hype ha burned ash almost dont even really expect come anymore cherry could wake personal messenger exclaiming coming still wouldnt believe itll announced rtomorrow doesnt make sense considering day gamepass seems like silksongs main sponsor xbox otherwise event like yeah worrisome avowed indy didnt exact date release look extremely fun though hope come asap would expect avowed release anywhere august october indy november december date set sketchy wouldnt give date thought wa likely probably couple month window work bug see date theyre reusing name sound like theyre weird thing plot description steam near future earth struck series global disaster bringing ecosystem around world verge collapse become joanna dark datadynes elite agent hunt world wanted criminal daniel carrington uncover mystery behind technological breakthrough could threaten life million twist itll predictable twist history isnt twist outraged im honestly pleasantly surprised theyre already working state decay mustve done better thought squeeze trigger cant believe many upvoted comment really rooting remasters new actually dont mind art style much could work kind way bit like exaggerated tarot card art inquisition ill never disrespect change art style wind waker probably still beautiful zelda ever made got much hate however tone trailer wa fucking horrific character nickname quip flying around quick cut thought wa marvel hero shooter saw title thought wa spinoff mobile learnt renamed dreadwolf wa fuck doesnt look like screenshots leaked gameplay around look much better fan though made companion seem like hero shooter intro im worried gon na quipy goofy without much serious tone qunari look clean supposed rugged brute kinda race yet got imperfection look like sims telltale character really shame dont give u honesttogod origin successor thats u wanted wa successful installment series reason theyve done copycat genre ever since gameplaywise origin wa faithful ode old baldurs gate even baldurs gate would show different art style release mentioned last week gameplay would come tuesday sad went forefront industry experimenting pushing boundary rpg insecure badly copy whatevers popular dont know theyre scared especially bg elden ring saw crazy critical commercial success confident uncompromising design offering unique experience bioware like uhm uhm make like fortnite imagine must felt seeing bg well dragon age keep pivoting farther farther away model dragon age heard wa renamed dread wolf dont know new called thought wa spin look nothing like dragon age wa getting mtg vibe grittiness edge imagination computer bang quick possible generic sterile visuals ive never played fortnite overwatch youre gon na help mean definitely looked like rpg gameplay shown th wa confirmed day ago sort suicide squad hope show something really good even though dunno good gameplay rpgs like dragon age usually story lvl design make difference came say im p like year xbox cooked p gamer since og console even im happy xbox put great show competition good industry really hope xbox get back day term respect influence yeah playstation showcase wa mid xbox buying lot seems worked least showcase agreed happy shown multi platform gameplay wa interesting genuinely double take part shit wa horrifying horror film atm wa absolutely disgusting indiana jones yo mom indiana jones hip square temple doom enters chat music choice later kinda lacked memorable song storm hope go back standard thats saying others bad music didnt stick much compared bts probably im playing gear war right first time good far highly recommend least go back gear access xbox entire trilogy backwards compatible infact id recommend replay trilogy amazing worthy follow cap story nicely definitely worth playing youve never done cod diablo available xbox wow wa asking mostly unknown french studio develops new flight sim scratch innovative feature ever video real time streaming map texture transformation almost entire world scale full support add marketplace doe set franchise name engine working great seems like exactly right time sort new feature gameplay shown tuesday also way

dont forget atm erebus stage guess ha licensing right issue epic coalition know serious wanting fenix collection ah wa wondering gear ue wasnt pc steam deck moment see steam steam sadly gear gear steam though knew gear wa steam honestly idea ue wa window well thanks confirming yes however op mean xbox gear rough launch day bad server coalition launch mile ahead crazy cant anything right lol halo infinite good right took year first trailer didnt feel like fable felt like snl sketch someone wa described fable felt fabley npc goofy attitude architecture wa right think need narrator tho hope main character doesnt talk bro got voice acting job fantasy character beard us sword auto accept garuda comment fucking brilliant true true guess im accustomed thinking five finger death punch heavy metal lol heard aiming pretty bad first played wa always dying turn really gun inaccurate hollow knight development went much theyre bad planning point wont live expectation tc ha said news come directly need patience silksong wa announced elden ring wa thats bad screen shot second gameplay video crazy idea even look like coming exclusively iphone guess everything said set date pushed first half everything said last quarter indy ha release date know avowed wa leaked quickly removed website wa leak official obsidian blog post wa quickly changed stating november th avoweds release date wa

wa going announcement also drop pas didnt stop announcing wa kinda whatever saw turn based combat leo pointing tv meme got series x target new sure regularly see series marketplace like incredible amount value thats many jumping love service bandwagon successful like gta online make billion course fail simply sustainable either way trojan horse sale junk food night isi hear plea wrath god divine intervention thats remember besides already mentioned doesnt gear war license belong xbox studio although probably could soundtrack licensing issue gear ue remaster came pc year ago xbox studio many question microsoft bought gear entire thing year ago epic connection left wa able pc downloaded xbox pas app access essentially like using another launcher dont agree story element gear release bumpy mile ahead current state gaming industry today gear released almost bug super solid multiplayer player story writing coalition killing mc wa talking trailer think wa ingame cutscene point gon na

fan unfortunately im really demographic simon marcy adventure time joel ellie need however understand wa good great story halfway decent combat honestly gave p niche sorely needed p p regret playing series watched tv series love bloodborne requires aggressive rallying mechanism healing moving also figure rolling properly roll attack towards offhand took couple year bloodborne really click really enjoyed control arent even bad hope talking keyboard mouse control awful control ever faced like hell though double tap button dodge simply idiotic thing ever put dodge heavy played controller ah still playing morrowind like bos huh dont blame half life great id never gone back ive tried skyrim least time make sure dont skip combat trainer character suck hard combat farm kid simulates making combat control intentionally shitty youre low level combat trainer actually teach fight control get better also repeat lesson build ability leave camp feel like need minimum period time new launch

funniest mixed british accent wail fucking rabbit minute series welsh catgirl lot like talk lineup iv ev wan na pokemon thing really pay attention type weakness super simple chart online long follow like standard rpg know grind switch party etc little core significant challenge unfortunately bad time jump current main series let say undercooked nintendo ha ever put ever choose pokemon good especially heartgold soulsilver though youd emulate currently pop lineup piss easy complete pokemon may encounter roadblock specifically two gym fight endgame elite type diversity isnt great never challenge cant overcome bit levelling really want accessible ocarina time best version think youre able get gta fun though id advise spending income online mode tried hid locker kept hearing nearby never finished doom dead space point clicked brain corridor enemy coming behind air duct inevitable good weapon ammo ive always managed big deal telling stopped scary alternative tried also completely negates intent replace music something cute funny even scary become hilarious feel minute starfield hated started called horse simulator pushed making fun got insane thing happen super ridiculous like accidentally backed favorite horse train getting unexpectedly attacked grizzly horse run fail tutorial need start last hour yeah dont get hype rdr well scenically breathtaking narratively intriguing chance outlaw cowboy west quite cool fantasy let least wa thing nearly enough keep engaged also making fiddly control slow pacing place make feel better put hour felt like nothing wa happening chore man yes oh god take hour get walking slowly snow intro trust felt get snow get settled get lot better spent hour hunting bear fuck got thing loved rdr hour got bored might love intro snowstorm winter atmosphere chef kiss think really well done slower paced introduction mechanic backstory almost dropped intro picked month got fanatic intro reason havent played yet couldnt want go back day cant justify personally dude way rdr friend tell amazing love single player get rdr reason ive restarted least time problem ha legendary animal stuff side stuff much get bored repetitive really dumb end got prologue realised wa hour wa go grocery store dont patience slow paced let fun cowboy shit fuck help see le long list thing like world live dont try everything youre supposed outside scripted main mission nothing actually time sensitive take long want slow take go poker bar smoke cigarette watch traveler go buy apple horse general store go hunt deer fish creek watch sun set soak mission youre ready slower paced purpose everyone really love think latter lot easier get former start fighting thing levelling within first hour witcher least never completed though watched dad complete twice instead saw get ending saw real point finishing wa halfway combat system wat god hate made kind person nowadays focus always bland story never gameplay yay get read bunch text box instead actually playing watch generic movie read generic book well lore sometimes pretty deep main focus story dont mean characternobody give shit guygirl mean player emotion go playing point youre going fromsoftware rather soulsbourne armored core definitely imo thats good know ive played except sekiro next list starfield maybe need console zero problem learning using ship control xbox ever used controller love flight control think reason gravitate often rpg character creation real time action berseria well regarded tale played berseria arise sorry loved magic arise wa fun way symphonia deleted honestly hardest part reach absolutely gorgeous good dont get wrong also dont really consider undertale good even though time favourite mine experience ha gameplay inside colossus gorgeous short story climb cool monster try fall thats gameplay monster hunter dont original instead butchered remake got didnt know wa earlier sorry confusion havent even cracked open homie ill probably start vii x another hear nothing good thing thats ff embarrassing series never touched like five undisputed classic along bunch solid entry hope stick story amazing entire way ffx favorite sure youll get love character even get x make feel like pretty beloved general get first real sequel series could elaborate never heard anything demo liked later much went back see started yes dont feel pressurized fun fact easter egg painting mario ocarina time thats daisy rosalina haha ive slowly playing witcher since next gen update released although mostly boring keep going back pretty easy dont thick much ok feel compelled let know started playing mass effect first time nobody ha ever made mention feel pretty similar kotor yes doesnt star war charm man doe charm deleted know dropped college wow specially funnily enough found patience often wa effective aggressiveness bloodborne yep pc control pc person stay far away console place needed like nier nwahing stopping right like criminal scum year minimum thats true id say irredeemable period time relevance like year ive tried vii remake im sure always look kid successfully beat even pokémon time complicating head something thats honestly solid advice im otherwise huge rpg fan dig treating way otherwise make want consider going back try particular youd recommend emulate steam deck switch option available believe get way worse thats deal first hour two quite long like easy starfield slow burn sure im hour really enjoy youre looking lot action youll probably disappointed skyrim got attacked naked hobo wood playing last time go ride sundown recently started playing fun really storycharacters setting kind cowboy simulator sort way gameplay standpoint think generally exciting context youre make interesting make sense im maybe twenty hour absolutely wouldnt give like place think production value nearly unmatched story character least point still keeping thing interesting like ha gameplay production value story least feel overall like love scenery really story fantastic got tired run horse min time get anywhere quest control awful thing dont need slow simulation get anything done im rd oh yeah definitely dont think bad take bit get learn basic skill get little tedious going back second time know expect nearly rough totally understandable yeah go back twice buddy told thing get youll love definitely slog argument rdr fantastic wild west love letter simulator art house masterpiece terrible everything get way gamification quality life took care year ago everything requires cutscene feel like youre constantly getting way go way sometimes im happy main quest calling good time try everything like origin odyssey everything enjoyed hour rdr felt like everything wa extra tedious like mini chew sandwich obviously thats thing really felt like sometimes excellent even bang bang cowboy stuff wrapped long cutscenes travel time nothing stopping robbing store stopping train ever want thats biggest problem dont enjoy combat eitherat know writing phenomenal im hr lol conflate storytelling book show video great medium story telling fact arguably best interactivity unique say like good story immediately bad gameplay default plenty videogames tell fun interesting story still fun example shovel knight get thats enough fully agreed wa going specifically list soulsbourne sekiro feel like standard others keep mind sekiro point like soulsborn favorite title fromsoft closely followed bloodborne soul closer batman arkham crack tried pc sure matter arise wa great think story berseria best fairly unique among jrpgs tale fantastic world story though never really go wrong man wan na try monster hunter still maybe world need lot time ive trying beat zestiria since came every year get another hour want like much dont agreed played way late beautiful kind boring like journey wa also waited way long wa story rather gameplay butchered ive played cant recommend old p lol original trilogy overthrow destroys greek pantheon pick deal fallout indirectly id say give try youre able recently decided actually starting release even getting hour overall wa really impressed even picked ragnorak gotten pretty far baldurs gate holding attention currently p story action even though definitely hard place id say best p story take place fantasy world look gorgeous even ha somewhat fun combat though time played wa used dmc bayonetta wa surprised god war gone character action third person shoulder wasnt big fan new combat system finished gave friend blast wa exact kind enjoys ha slightly different combat system surrounding completely turnbased still jobbased ha unique levelling system basically job based system mean character attack timed interval sometimes cool faster slower depending move youre using bit overwhelming probably fun someone bored turn based felt wa easiest get sure also think lot shorter though could wrong suggestion definitely necessary give nice background familiarity character freaking awesome right rosalina princess part mario universe daisy mario princess played witcher last year opinion base wa kind mid bad given expectation felt bit disappointing dlcs elevated whole thing lot ended loving basically kotor original ip modern thank much may push needed something le scope kotor still great havent played difference patience turtling behind shield still learn attack pattern punish enemy general better getting hit rather hit baiting parry example dont console either played cheap controller bought aldi wa enjoyable havent used controller since yea like said least year like someone feeling guilty cyberpunk pubg rdr sure weird gatekeep feel right compared still launching ive never played either cant say compare rest series really isnt difficult bigger challenge come playing player likely time specially made team necessaryhonestly feel best consider sword shield switch bad lot pokemon might better start earlier definitely could never get skyrim really rpgs arent deleted definitely problem built massive rpgs damndirty mike boy near blackwater anything convincing thing ive actually starfield intro really long boring hour best ive ever played find telling exact thing played rdr tell think youre completely right dont know youre getting downvoted entire selling point simulative quality graphic excellent gameplay lack thereof detroit become human serf specific purpose appeal like get better graphic storytelling time without needing sacrifice gameplay quality novelty wear kept encountering thing first time required know thing either quickly explained moment briefly explained shortly learning duel duel learn lock enemy minute later get ambushed enemy horseback die havent practiced locking shot yet accidentally kill someone taught hide body would ever find someone find immediately wa hour wa punished everything dissatisfying see mean issue rdr odyssey much side content eventually get repetitive misunderstand meaning agree saying issue dont use strength medium interactivty tell story use strength medium like book movie reading text watching cutscenes want story told playing love fromsoft story said first usually idea whats going watch hour youtube video get lmao totally understand wouldnt gorgeous nature alive around ive spent good amount time looking environment fighting heartpounding feel dangerous story pretty good experience exploring building character also get palico cat familiar go journey dress mine look like chipmunk hawaiian shirt adorable helpful companion im completely hooked yeah lot use gameplay enhance storytelling experience rather action focus colossus early example originally come p gotten two remasters still requires focus definitely get main novelty story thats told yup really good played wa really world oh thought rosalina wa space princess something never played fair thats good im nearly finished main story although starfield wont back worth promise think wtf ha backburner enjoy definitely make sense thats competitive fps know could spend lot time git gud dont interest dying till right im absolutely loving many varied way fun right im playing uc storyline im thinking im going either take major detour start alt ha absolutely interest combat doe science skyrim massive okay think word describe huge skyrim thats excellent comparison rdr even close detroit become human lol even little first h played rdr gameplay sometimes walked goal sprinting jogging even fast traveling horse vibing detroit would something closer visual novel rdr city thats fair think balance struck connecting back uesoteric_enigma would actually disagree say really enjoy story soulslikes obviously isnt main focus like told world building subtle hint environment world story isnt super obvious pay attention yeah

another bloated mess remove actual depth sake half baked poorly implemented rpg element live service garbage ill skip entirely far cry wa last ubisoft bought wont buy another start making actual focus effort put nah think itll visually nice substantively shallow simple newer styled combat weak narrative typical mechanic im sure itll sell fine serviceable im personally going mid get edit btw youre interested setting op ghost tsushima havent yet seems like perfect youre interested time period setting nope got enough library stop post love idea ubisoft ha lot problem regarding quality attitude towards industry id like see least try fix give money didnt like origin valhalla wa sooo overwhelming busy work quest zapped fun wa quickly odyssey wa fun also kinda problem apparently far focused review say respect player time might actually buy day assuming finish kcdii time ive wagon close decade dont really see changing cant help look see sink ubisoft tho sale maybe mirage least year le stellar way handled research marketing wa disrespectful japan personally turned away certainly full price yes time soon real reason know ubisoft go close black friday additionally much quality stuff id rather prioritize another gorgeous checklist like nope im sure well plenty buy even wa gamepass wouldnt waste bandwidth storage space wa amazing became typical ubisoft unfortunately imo gave odyssey solid hour realized would take another hour get good part gave think valhalla ganepass im giving go heard even worse maybe sale decent price considering dont p im franchise unfortunately look like ghost tsushima either way hope good entry franchise stopped excited long time ago post valhalla good ive played valhalla got burned shit burned ubisoft consistent know exactly getting probably deep discount review well big backlog broke buying full price could persuaded yotei though wont say ill never price ever right downtime release im actually actively interested id give try full price

release loved liked took long break series came back origin loved odyssey liked valhalla thought wa ok really excited apparently review calling great thus far would wait discount bothering mirage wa good pretty substandard whole im interested ubisoft anymore especially many collectible open world feel formulaic boring didnt even finish origin odyssey skipped valhalla played mirage ended rushing get kind confirmed isnt anymore id try hear ubisoft majorly change approach open world aspect interest came free b nope dont plan never really found fun first yeah last played wa origin thought wa

ubisoft make bad constantly kinda newcomer series perhaps everything new vast exciting every iteration comparatively le le exciting really dont think ill give try even literally free animosity towards studio rather spend time thing dont think ive ever purchased ubisoft life im probably person never wanted japan set setting thats many already dont think formula would add enough make fresh dont care black guy stuff whatever kind thing mean nothing dont want look like watered ghost tsushima also didnt really care doesnt help ha getting worse valhalla flat wasnt good mirage may gone back root brought along many thing didnt like modern entry im paying attention typical reason waiting till half dw origin rise ronin attention right till ghost yotei come plus many great looking original formula coming next month attention moreso seems fun ill grab sale sometime look promising im antiubisoftformula generally dont like fuck much like far cry headshot wouldnt drop bad guy instantly used

like ubisoft aaa absolute shit cant think single franchise would willing pay full price plus inevitable mtx dlc wait year get twenty buck id like give big shoutout diablo last aaa wa stupid enough preorder ultimate edition even completely let also nod gamepass letting try bunch trashwagons hey starfield without spending additional cabbage sadly gamepass longer worth damn either thats okay thing go sale got big ol backlog doe look like new norm thats much kcdii wa fear gta vi real social medium better brotherhood wa excellent wa last purchased release multiplayer wa simple fun black flag wa also good wa distinctly really well ever want japan ghost tsushima youve never played iv origin check theyre top objectively among best open world generation im sure many take granted think gross misgeneralization passion effort went making tropical caribbean world aciv world ancient egypt origin leap screen still havent forgotten played aciv first time sailing ship towards sunset flock flamingo fly nearby sandbar sublime origin wandering desert camel suddenly sandstorm roll get blinded able see front wind hyena den discover cool secret cause got lost filled many beautiful small moment world around actually feel alive without direct input actually made dev team quality control carried iv origin bounced ditched ezio couldnt arsed yeah really need bunch gamergate goombas know new ubisoft probably going generic slop know diehard fan franchise must exist genuinely hope enjoy ubisoft isnt publisher ive interest like almost decade last yakuza ive played wa judgment spin tho want get back series cant new protagonis ichiban kasuga bro lack much common sense even good dude majima gaiden man forgot name thats nice thought let honest studio dependent release already yep minimum month later finished star war outlaw last month wa lot polished came read online save money star war outlaw plenty time rest month mirage cancelling subscription way outlaw wa good value would much dont want give money ubisoft good chance able rent local library live small town able borrow even new library usually interlibrary loan within month two release historical setting compelling like attempting even dont always nail im curious launch go like cp got rightly hammered released unplayable gaming public back around loving wa fixed still remember sw battlefront ii also getting gamers upset anger inducing levelling system studio went back gaming public learned love ubisoft launch acceptable state minor tech issue test inherit gameplay look actually good free expansion preorder probably otherwise thats care enough first place worry missing dlc isnt always case devil advocate many choose buy within first week release signal type developer worth future investment last heard ubisoft isnt well financially however good development team ubisoft quebec odyssey ubisoft blue byte mainz anno series think fair show support give time resource developer need deliver something good also equally fair ignore terrible release settler remake wa developed ubisoft blue byte düsseldorf wa huge disappointment new stealth system see old cant instantkill enemy theyre elite cant instantkill enemy number higher nonsense dont care anymore japan would leaping joy back brotherhood main year old mainline get last mirage still system sale wa budget release launch unlike website need use pc yep wait patch fix greatsword insect glaive im replaying ghost tsushima right im done im gon na get review good im replaying unity right steam deck im thoroughly enjoying yet understand disliked launch played year late purchased p everything wa mostly fixed played ghost tsushima time enjoyed however wa set rural tsushima island mainland japan wa ton japanese stuff never got see depicted interestingly previous open world historical samurai come last year ghost rise ronin like dragon ishin set sengoku era classic samurai era time great unifiers others take place time period mainland honshu im excited exploring especially kyoto played ghost tsushima year back historical japanese style well im sure need another experience want ghost yotei coming well director historically accurate island tsushima ha named permanent ambassador work noting significant increase tourism area isnt exactly shaping historically accurate never really matter seeing recruitable female sumo wrestler think theyre done adding official apology post yet context sumo wrestling traditionally man sport much woman arent allowed enter ring say allowed mean literally outlawed almost year allowed enter ring professional setting even nurse entering ring save contestant medical emergency ground cancel tournament thats main reason im hyped devs made odyssey odyssey wa peak franchise imo ive playing since got seems interesting wonder bunch backlash though aswell since setting literally based mongol invasion japan kinda similar really like setting two main char clicking would could create char super excited well enjoying th two day crazy think major studio ha ever thought four season year open world map actionstealth racing car forza horizon britain wa exquisite every week new seasonclimate new way explore world wa amazing experience driving car idea importing idea sound like ton fun liberation neat waiting bus playing psp otherwise bad played console mobile identity couldnt hidden really liked liberation played vita actually ended playing time im guessing doesnt hold much compared full fledged console played remaster trying convince anything worth mentioning even u hyped would agree valhalla wa garbage look distinctly different closer actually liked like odyssey origin valhalla wa drag im even sure ever ended beating main story hour dreadful regret hour spent comment imagine getting mad someone dont want give money company anymore lol unless missed something early access early access doe feel like hate outright false haha early access doe feel like hate outright false haha decent hope also screw preorders lowered quality aaa launch decade nowrush preorder sale fix gamebreaking bug later going wait see actually worth premium price tag usual dont preorder wa never disappointed either completionist loved origin odyssey wa let valhalla mirage batting average want find listen whatever bandwagon trend online know first hand asian male erasure large problem must admit playing tsushima would feel weird playing yasukes character ancient japan odd choice compared every series yeah agree wouldnt anything stop buying good yasukes abit strange choice feel like positive discrimination really negative let take character japanese history black single defining feature black weve established skin colour correct build character yasuke basically doe exist anything japanese history served nobunaga wa black going broader definition straight racism ubisoft go even incel anything like seems like ticking little diversity box black character nonnative setting aaand woman guess release tell though definitely interesting thing told ubisofts weird though wow thats dick thing say im curious still day reviewer many aaa unplayable release wait review first give origin shot strike great balance rpg classic odyssey wa went super hard looter territory origin mythical stuff really present main save like drugged bos fight odyssey wa leaned lot monster main dont like western savior bro ubisoft know point whether thats something youre interested going need low sodium subreddit lol gon na get spooky cd projekt red famously cyberpunk deleted weird played never ran bug towards end biggest bug found wa wa unable open chest kind bug run know obviously exist new patch said fixed wa surprised perfectly ran launch thing ppl didnt run breaking bug bug encountered p wa audio cut scene went shit much polished anything else ive played recently release elden ring baldurs gate good monster hunter seems alright seems like enjoying kcd another debatable considered aaa gta buy day regardless even wa buggy mess release fully aaaday purchase thing like thatbut seems like pick choose cant justify pre ordering etc pre order fan diablo wa last paid full price never fr waiting complete product cheaper price ha go last year red dead redemption wa last time paid full price elden ring many title become absolutely amazing later half price cyberpunk alltime favorite ever paid physical disc copy target month release issue played wa actually good update later beat twice second playthrough wa phantom liberty dlc paid full price mainline rockstar since gta lived hype launch imo online department outsourcing ha hurt reputation bit still devs pre order anything gta red dead redemption gta rdr easily justifiable find le painful drop kind money like kcd gta amount depth make feel worthwhile exactly need retvrn forum must go back better reddit hard bad facebook point always say black flag favorite pirate odyssey masterpiece bit grindy ioved brotherhood multiplayer wa fun idk say bf wasnt feel like perfect edward kenways story follows many beat ezios really make feel like order destined home desperate lowest point become hero

lost crown amazing wanted sequel damn ubisoft yeah naoe im pretty sure yasuke doesnt stealth stuff yes assassination arent lethal elite enemy level thats stealth work yes know setting stealth designed differently combat required setting turn believe least thats recall hearing video showcasing stealth could wrong think perk disables get parroted part anti jerk mainline like year greatsword feel good new wound mechanic make hit feel satisfying gaurd parry cause big damage great sword fucking awesome tried g world like much tried rise wa okay still felt putting playing wild love amazing weapon absolutely recommended insect glaive bad weapon ive tried far feel relatively good compared world insect glaive better ever careful would lynch alive saying according sub last good wa second

trilogy excellent vampyr also pretty dialogue heavy found dialogue pretty boring eventually started skipping dont remember missing anything important think wa right thinking npc talk much without anything worthwhile say detroit become human almost entirely dialogue choice based moment qte fight chase scene almost actual gameplay come playing detective sense stagesmissions broken two segment segment investigation youll explore environment find clue among object read interact open additional option path dialogue path wont revealed segment segment confrontation youll either interrogate fight flee someone segment dialogue option available based discovered segment environmental option say door unlocked segment available escape route segment youre looking something fastpaced

safely say favourite ever played like time oh geez point editing knew meant guess lol gravity rush remaster first never played dead space impulse bought remake based review played time even looking another proper trip played rest series asylum barely demo compared insane batman shit city knight im surprised loved kotor didnt want try mass effect fighting different roleplay aspect similar remakerebirth follow along action side ffxiv turn based mmo also free first expansion check realm reborn base trailer fairly recent update allow almost entirely solo even though mmo get thought wa

great think last made strategy kenabridge spirit wishlist seems like decent evil west thought shooter wishlist shooter remember trying zeno clash long time ago dont even remember ha good praise yes reminded tmnt wanted removed store started quest looking something similar dont remember ended playing maybe marvel avenger check others played dragon dogma remember good new vega fallout series fallout ive watched lot nioh video cant maje mind soul close far combat dark soul glad think despite hype around wukong still think kinda underrated lol yea mount blade strategy would argue unless multiplayer although could actually make allinfantry archer setup fight infantry front line think similar taste enjoyed kind gameplay lot haha also maybe try honor see sale got unique fun melee system however mainly pvp get slice bunch regular goon match however never played arkham think complaint gotham knight wa didnt copy combat darksiders fury whip main weapon thinking darksiders genesis wa isometric coop rpg since played evil west wa thinking gun wa combo finisher thing watched video got quite mix shooting melee maybe much shooting looking decent like nv mod mostly bigger better youre looking good melee gameplay fallout unlikely satisfy scratch particular itch melee build tend pretty niche often trick pony get really boring imo least without mod animation pretty bad well basic little variety said doesnt feel good like lot listed clunky pretty much exactly dont want shooter melee tacked afterthought share similarity meant difficult bonfire system combat different soul substantially better particular department far better indeed similarcomparable soul altho jedi series say liked note cant believe nobody ha said sekiro ha similar combat jedi series yea honor great whats miasing market melee looter shooter style something like warframe first descendent although warframe ha significant melee combat feel weird animation fast end pressimg button marvel avenger wa closest live service maybe last entry kill justice league wa also like failed good point kinda looking forward gothsm knight ditched old combat think darksiders kinda shit wejt isometric approach hopefully thry make new like old nowadays soul genre slapped everything originally demon soul dark soul mainly represented difficulty however low end studio also copy combat backstabber damage stamen clunky combat playing star war hardest difficulty yes feel like soul format save style respawns enemy loss exp etc dont care mechanic difficulty whats important fluid combat retaining realism usually true source soul like fluid animation curve get steep point feel nothing wrong dark soul fun also want different type combat sekiro already wishlist although put soul like idea fluid combat directly compare ive seen gameplay felt lie p closer dark soul black myth wukong furthest sekiro kinda wouldnt know sure till try haha maybe year soulframe would fit bill yeah get love soul combat deff nothing special sure carried enemyboss design rather player actually sekiros combat fluid unlike soul combat primary focus maybe youve already played option may like bloodborne combat still soul sure compared dark soul faster fluid overall far better imo sek bb use sidestep rather goofy rolling bb parrying much slick doesnt require shield neither ha lame af soul backstabs bb ha much better take sekiro doesnt even stamen weighing cant say sure youll like either ofc feel pretty confident recommending especially sekiro felt lie p closer dark soul black myth wukong furthest sekiro kinda havent played either yet grain salt id probs say oh yeah id maybe say nioh land somewhere bloodborne sekiro thats new devs warframe promising regard hopefully thought wa single player experience well live service crimson desert well need see theyre planning finally releasing cool stuff check try oh yea soulframe gon na live service sure sure entire thing later ive gotten test access far like single player melee focused odyssey form man squad mission farm boss melee feel ok nothing ground breaking yet think crimson desert look great seems lot creativity', 'good free roaming open world im looking similar oblivion morrowind fallout big open world free explore however want rpg would cool required want story like fallout mean want coherent make sense make want go storyunlike oblivion thought story completely sucked didnt make want continue also want able story whenever dont want ive already played oblivion morrowind fallout stalker gta im looking something new edit im looking pc dead rising cause great liked gta could try saint row think sr wa similar ive played sr also mount blade warband would highly recommend isnt much directed storyline like raise huge army b increase status amongst fellow lord c create kingdom however much stuff youll experience unique let get idea like arcanum gothic gold exactly looking big open world lot detail npc schedule multiple solution nearly quest great amount stuff wont see first playthrough trust want th witcher lot fun enhanced edition steam make move witcher even enjoyable since high hope might actually know whats going world theyve set iswas favorite time probably dated wish theyd bring back remake prototype like gta superhuman ability reason hop car run faster x like x reunion open space simulator lot fun borderland happens sale supes cheap today steam give prototype try generally crappy uninspired story pretty fun time fucking around kinda like infamous liked little better even though wa lot le polished testament actually finished prototype sold copy infamous risen good big oblivion world detailed immersive go anywhere want ive never big sandbox style im playing cause right fun expected world huuuuuuuuuuuuuge doesnt feel like endless generic map sprawl im surprised complaint far combat mediocre start little badass latter something expect everyone take issue haha deadly premoniton openworld survival horror budget title graphic stuff arent best story character really make oh got twin peak vibe going youve ever seen eve online mmos get lost space hour new vega cant go wrong red dead redemption farcry also ok xenus precursor pathologic void stalker old school crowd avernum series upwards town filled npc quest pretty good story id probably start avernum quite bare bone story arent connected directly anyway stalker chernobyl seems like need little minecraft life like gta youd probably like red dead redemption think gta wild west great story big open world fun gameplay favourite cause actual favourite probably infamous said pc red faction guerrilla pretty awesome open world often encouraged blow shit sky fucking high company made red faction also made saint row imagine gta whore earn respect use septic truck spray shit steam wanted get emulator probably plethora psxboxgamecube could try cant really think top head though another thing could try due ex open world level deep intriguing enough feel open world point also many way go beating level choice make level affect event later great story well mercenary ha fairly big world must bit get free roam wolfquest greatest open world ever conceived katamari damacy cause blow mind apart good way saboteur open world like gta set nazi occupied france havent completed yet ive found quite fun plus booby freelancer stole many hour life like eve online except single player engaging combat blast dont need joystick story good become whoever want hope played fallout oblivion used mod arent even worth playing without mod id highly suggest fallout wanderer edition youve never played entire series since heavily storybased story need correct sequence also first chore since nowhere near good sequel aside control story aspect get past first last hour youre hell experience realize get karma self post dead rising limited term time true open world sandbox imo still fun though skooooorpioooooooo seriously jc amazingly fun spiderman meet gta meet every b action movie ever need cause order completely separate la gta series double amount customization saint row breath fresh air openworld fun hell sr super fun great concept beware might super buggy computer run like cause around medium high graphic sr choppy hell sometimes bad case consoleitis doesnt get way good sized world countless hour thing oh word wa nice scope arcanum massive make fallout look like predecessor also ha greatest roleplaying mechanic time hand find almost impossible argue otherwise simply based massive openended nature felt close pp campaign arcanum wanted something wa usually way want kill gilbert bates go appleby take even get mentioned ending montage rolled idiotic savant halfogre oh lord backstories could chose character brilliant idea met nasrudin wa offended stupidity dialogue choice attacked fucking proposed protagonist good guy tried kill mespoiler beat religious pulp wa immediately transported void unbelievable mention roll low intelligence character diary entry written like idiot tell ha much attention detail sorry sound like gushing arcanum major achievement design writing unrecognized damn shame witcher isnt necessarily openworld however akin dao merely travel small point larger world map far cry worth look lot find frustrating still find hold merit main thing bother get attacked every check point map kinda covered check point expect opposed least couple whenever try go somewhere mount blade warband also worth look actually havent played warband first understanding much improvement anyways allows lot freedom run around map rag tag army joining king opposing bandit pillaging town youre id really recommend look looked like ton fun wish p edit also many system picked amazon cheap remember wanting first came remember getting bad review first didnt get ill look though tried playing borderland friend house didnt find fun seemed like generic third person shooter extra thing added make little different second weird quirk difficult time autoleveling found big bird kicking fairly common occurrence beginning level bit get combat quite fun youll blast though end wa feeling opposite constantly overwhelmed think bit quicker fantastic though utterly beautiful never fasttravelled wa wonderful look travel see upvote coffee spin ship around station hour eve isnt dont plot course set training regimen space hour literally hour try year heard wa pretty much exactly fallout vega instead dc true dont really want different setting forgot mention im looking pc sadly cant red dead redemption really wanted like precursor lack polish wa much fuck xenus bought seeing everyone saying oh bad diamond rough blew mind terrible wa wa like someone put stalker blender mixed exlax drank shit put back blender far cry added even exlax drank shit drank puked added crappy voice sold thing dont like minecraft goal im creative enough make got first steam ago hated seemed like would fun couldnt simply walk place another without attacking walk slowly magically radar something think happened horse wa enough quit playing slow made walk series like weird almost like wa asking question looking actual response instead karmawhoring crazy right hell doe karma trying find fun actually good point least free roam unaccessible due opened storyline annoying cant fuck around must story line area opened fool around get cah isnt plot youre latin american dude blow shit thats need know never played first love second isnt whole lot plot involved would fine probably best view cause like b movie pretty bad voice acting bare minimum plot damn fun great best way cause ignore plot download cheat infinite ammo fast black market possibly superman flight go make challenge long leave health still pose challenge pretty much wa smoother would much better still managed bunch fun beat despite like think gta none realism much ridiculousness havent played thing remember able unlock unlimited ammo certain weapon although realistic allows fun completely obsessed beat played side mission wish story wa bit better action completely floor found gta freeroam online go onsale le would get got middling review blast mostly mindless destructive fun level power crazy shit first person shooter doesnt sound like youre talking thats alt tabbingmultiple monitor reddit removed major difference storywise factionwise new vega whereas fo could good evil neutral new vega ha whole range faction like dislike ending widely varied well similar original fo fo ending overall think new vega much improved fo thats like saying fo new vega theyre amazing really vast improvement storyline lot deeper cover many branch combination really take world direction want via clan fighting region unfortunately poorly coded expect frequent crash lot bug basically yes good change like iron sight quest gun much better main quest opinionseveral path take enemy completely different exception deathclaws scorpionsand fiend basically raider still well worth order pc gamestop far cry isnt bad though althought get redundant fast place samey cant could possibly join multiplayer server give goal work towards understandable lol wa worth shot end getting desperate though pretty cheap far far easy waste entire day away make giant penis gold diamond wa worst opinion like type mission everyone hate brotherhood address claim well made varied term mission weapon like highly reccomend get mile ahead okay im getting really tired understanding work ive put lot time doe time restriction want beat accomplish mission surely doesbut want ignore mission continue thats time restriction broken skorpio skorpio skorpio disregard cutscenes wont miss thing maybe im mistaken strd person part since played first came remember borderland remember wanting lot hype first released went played friend house thought wa nothing special bad invisible wall main outside world still big continuous open world place like fo actually seems like ha depth exploring nice world recommended thats mostly want right think might end playing first played maybe fc got bored everything wa brown brown savannah brownish jungle brown car brown everyone wa wearing khaki combat wa fun mechanic great aesthetically couldnt get behind far cry great try permadeath run delete save die force avoid patrol checkpoint two worst thing buddy system make sure second change fuck far cry make lol south african accent since south african try hard like leo blood diamond played maybe fc got bored everything wa brown brown savannah brownish jungle brown car brown everyone wa wearing khaki combat wa fun mechanic great aesthetically couldnt get behind deleted thats good know series always seemed like would fun sequel fixed problem first might important finish first though directly continues modern day part plot historical part entirely new plot thread carry historical part apple edenspoiler yeah basement unaccessible whole didnt even mention time restriction thats issue part dead rising problem thing like car bike basement arent accessible unless progress story careful serdadu powerful magic within literally million million different gun nothing special borderland pretty damn unique opinion liked fallout good chance youll like fallout new vega bug find annoying gamebreaking yes outside world giant open world place lot thing discover exploration definitely rewarding storyline great edit fallout wa exploring giant ruined city new vega exploring wilderness far know invisible wall mostly slope implausible climb think actually better fallout respect fo invisible wall edge map new vega us cliff mod remove invisible wall also suggestion cause torrent work btw im retarded looking system tag first interesting story two direct sequel like minute end honestly could survive wikipedia version plot youtube video mechanic bothered much personally thought wa brilliant story great far fetched ending lacked mechanic back inversely wa hard become immersed gameplay wa x better brotherhood best world really need beat understand ill weigh went fallout new vega asscreed got bored latter hour wa fun dont get wrong didnt tickle openworld fancy way might looking know wa suggested elsewhere fallout new vega wa honestly best gaming experience ive last year half liked definitely worth picking im much huge gaming marathon new vega wa first time forever looked watch yeah still wear watch whatever wa like holy shit ive hour get four honestly wish could purge mind new vega fresh wa fantastic played ii fine lot fun ii great le hate least usually way amend mention awesome character story basically first establishes world myriad plot thread want skip try find sort youtube recap second doe make number reference first although none critical experience doe feel complete know everyones talking time theyre called different thing errr really like different gun different stats thats wa thinking ha bunch different weapon usually end finding like lot sticking almost never use anything else ton weapon isnt big deal different stats make unique different component gun randomly put together gun drop allows ridiculous number physically

place lot secretsrewards exploring love secret wall puzzle open unlocked door hidden cave treasure preferably handcrafted place attention detail npc stuff town traveling location hate dead world freedom design morrowind prime example lack level scaling make world feel hostile real making exploring dangerous also rewarding able go find overpowered gear early know look rather loot depending level make lot immersive little thing like skill certain level eg magic related skill progress mages guild add immersion whereas oblivion skyrim pure fighter doesnt know magic archmage anyway making feel like real place something immersive like see enemy fighting naturally would skyrim doe good job enemy faction engage sight wolf attack commoner smaller wildlife guard fend bandit attack like feel world alive without initiate everything fake door dont put door nothing break immersion fake door good character good narrative plenty excellent combat system give smaller busier open world barren large idk explain botwtotk really scratched itch allowing player traverse world navigate obstacle using tool disposal felt creative engaging fluid oh enemy lem fight rq becomes well sneak stun trick fighting someone else fly blow steal weapon attack ballons fly away etc feel like great experience opinion never get stale really feel like total control world cam interact whole new world dazzling place never knew lot npc thing talking thing world doe feel empty problem openworld often big empty yes go anywhere dont get level immersion nothing going fill world daily life great way explore world everything shown map start way like mentioned cause saint row similar made feel amazing screw around movement time enjoying world sandbox dont nail movement least want great hidden stuff like older fallout character explore exploration level design important need fun interesting thing find exploring dont need sandbox enjoyable world spend time combat secondary still somewhat important think sable would benefited greatly lite combat environmental hazard like sandworms chasing bike etc want sense stuff happening world even log immersive trait point interest interactivity feeling like make difference without forcing excitement explore new area meet new whatever want scenery love exploring world waht ha offer thats core point open world see something distance want go see treasure awaits might good idea might go horribly wrong sense adventure like dont get rewarded everytime go place look odd interesting go enjoy world gameplay wise prefer world player unguided let player make move progress rate ignore story line long fun world best example wa fallout new vega didnt touched main story benny hit level got lost another thing really like lot using fast travel first time played true open world wa skyrim level didnt realize wa fast travel system basically wa first open world expierence walked everywhere wa boring hell saw world another playthrough fast travel miss much opinion wa expierence still look fondly upon going ivarsted whatever wa called go thousand stair fighting rogue mages bandit troll sabercats road seeing village distance journey end playing another gameplay thing annoys combat progression combat stale look bethesda formula press kill button make kill thats dynamic nothing every bethesda progression like combat good progression enshrouded combat fun even mage parrying maybe finishing blow still viable often life saver progress absolute nightmare story also important story open world hit miss though dont already universe build upon hard convey universe new tell classic fromsoftware style classic narrative main quest short cutscene beginning folk world react story unfolds also easily suck fun least skyrim completly didnt care alduin overpowered gifted child god basically generic dragon doesnt anything except resurecting dragon barely interact yet main villain could mix match together fused love letter open world would mix sense adventure freedom elden ring progression bethesda story classic world warcraft classic wow nobody new region feel way better hero champion combat mordor narrative batman arkham yes open world world need really big man sky minecraft etc probably overkill valheim better maybe little small still feel like curated area defined border farcryskyrim etc must feel like point even going border feel like never see quarter world thousand hour mean procedurally generated massive also ha feel lived mean ha lot place thing within world much empty space instead large area wilderness bordered area dense stuff also interact monster kill friendly npc village interact minecraft manages reasonably well village expanded significantly diversity village type type village valheim world minecraft world really great struggle fill world meaningful stuff place lot area basically fly territory wilderness want walk get somewhere else village ruin cave thing see place visit etc etc second metric diversity like man sky wa vast dozen planet everything started feel repetitive newest patch go long way address tricky tempting use diversity diversely mean world need diversity also shouldnt feel like diversity isnt mixed sprinkled everywhere still seem diverse biome individually still large impressive way actually feel like make progress going biome another small close together get back flyover feeling expect average ten minute trip include quickly flying different biome get going defeat impact diversity think staging diverse biome minecraft valheim suffer problem biome farther apart really spend lot time discover new biome final thing building aspect feel reasonably organic lot survival building day use cookie cutter building system lack feel agency build thing minecraft valheim dont problem building system reasonably organic small piece fit together ever like however minecraft especially valheim suffer call ghost town syndrome build giant amazing place even whole village always empty living ghost memory maybe livestock place need degree minecraft really get sense important like fallout absolutely tiny little settlement barely build anything feel alive welcoming worth maintaining revisiting interact major metric build really good open world huge lived diverse established organic building living inhabitant put story world take time develop engaging combat mechanic inventory system talent tree etc etc standard rpg stuff dont build proper world first rest feel reused generic quickly fun enjoy simple range checklist whatever want sense place lived atmosphere evoking emotion via environment witcher rdr favourite open world able change thingsbuildingstowns like witcher free abandoneddestroyed town monster return rebuild fallout elder scroll dont make massive super big world trasverse make decent size map actually interesting explore landmark place interest maybe building dungeon way want explore loot even doesnt useful loot experience maybe town middle main quest main quest b buy thing talk local learn little lore book note maybe offer sidequest reward handsome enough sidetrack main quest world barren empty boring want fast travel time failed create compelling open world im looking rage choose two id go combined suggestion actually doe exist doesnt take place city forest wild desert large space take place single space station prey yes prey open world go part station pretty much time wish youre sneaky exploit exploit give best ever made eye ha ai cant imagine someone typing like town city id love able walk every building room see populated furniture object peoplemonsters random side quest even behind door procedurally populated onthefly lived random encounter open world traditional sense isnt appealing paper sound great vast majority open world would work better linear semiopen world great world need multiple thing grandiose must feel big great structure like mountain city cave etc special way city cave maybe constructed ceiling lava lake mountain might overhang ocean elden ring good example part done well surprising exploration feel like adventure simply ticking place set making visual barrier mountain range example obscure obscure mysterious thing like titanic body monster see something distance id like think whats beyond satisfying conclusion genshin impact wa treat regard evolving world changing either due constant change season cycle due whats happening story player shape world feel much unique elden ring us impersonal little opinion living world full motivation goal shouldnt utility gameplay make main character feel like part something greater actor stage baldurs gate great handling aspect like ha lot weapon option many also fan isnt clearly defined weapon meta bioshock good example mean isnt objectively best weapon better option different scenario entire infinite beaten starting pistol easily enough hindrance ammo small dense opposed large empty desire explore almost interest exploring fallout wa little story teleport side map even youve never teleporting event quest everything marked star link gps system actually explore rush b jetpacks fave thing elden ring way lot secret almost hidden plain sight looking map fallout feeling want open world maybe nostalgia clouding judgment remember even playing year still getting feeling feeling going random place discovering subway cult example whole culture thing interact made every marker map exciting unlike say something like dragon age inquisition every marker wa someone saying hey go get x amount plant meat medicine letter etc still remember coming across man boorh hill fallout wa sniper spot randomly marker nothing got sniper random exciting happen made everything feel explorable like never know youre gon na find vibe dont think ha really recreated feeling since absolutely loath open world time empty land artificial poi added top said im hour elden ring absolutely love mean something working also really liked ghostwire tokyo map wa small enough could focus specific area dont need horse equivalent mount navigate specific bit im bit odd hate use mount dont like degree movement sense discovery content mission design good story world feel alive freedom go story please like lot open world thing like much follows billion different collectable item scattered across world make world interesting explore secret etc need empty barren world mean certain area packed full shit whole others void life sometimes make sense dont see point hard block leaving zone like cant go yet high level wont open gate let find thing love nit comprehensive list exploration finding secret finding tough fight thst challenge story world building method travel understanding something term level design open world mutually exclusive like open world dont level genuinely confused someone ha explanation would appreciated simply empty fallout probably best cause everywhere go mission story ubisoft opposite putting collctible everwhere empty space say map big nothing bad genre ocarina time skyrim far cry mom pussy think mix maybe bit wan na world feel alive full interesting stuff quest also wan na know world story witcher perfect open world dont want stupid collectable shit form assasins however intend travel map better make fast enough dont feel like need use fast travel teleporting idgaf lived world much shit sometimes want go b fastest way still painfully fucking slow going teleport fallout favorite open world reason discovering boy fridge walking place place kept engaged ive played stuff actually find coolest part elden ring exploration wa could look weird looking feature map go find cool landmark get dungeon something make world feel like actual world see explore rather checklist isalso something xenoblade chronicle really well despite open world good open world must equally great level design gameplay former make want try latter keep long time freedom story important dominates may divide adventure two part main quest exploration either player get bored dint exploring find interesting thing finishing story definitely world look like alive many thing happening npc walking around carrying business attack occurring npc defending exploration must rewarding able use alchemy raise enchant skill armor order raise alchemy good design plenty stuff make even small world feel huge example yakuzajudgment whatever devs lean long great job many open world suck invested horizontally instead vertically many aspect lead lacking depth idc part open world decided held value long actually hold want really instead selecting two thing id like ill say thing dont want thoughtless procedurallygenerated anything progression player impact big open space map breathe seeing something waaaay distance making way even better involves map switch back obstacle fork road destination journey requires distance foot hurt make camp roll town fire feel welcoming breath wild wrong promote exploring world design worst open world design force player get high possible order glide need go fact player used ft get around inept design confirms ft useful tool player purposely refuse use want look around promotes exceptional design skyrim great example open world design truly hid many thing deep world yes dungeon repetitive isnt point fact wa found promoted dopamine level keep player engaged many bethesdas clearly work great open world design theyre studio cdpr witcher cyberpunk also exceptionally well done r fromsoftware captivated player open world well way fallen love new type open world best exampled hogwarts legacy nice open world doesnt take trillion hour explore nice compact area filled brim stuff mean many player walk without rely fast travel want return world also work exceptionally well flying get around whether broom buckbe er highwing truly enjoy walking area shrouded tree breaking open safe zone hamlet thrown thing get little dicey hop broom hit safety moment im hoping well begin see world design similar hl really believe player engaged without feeling overwhelmed isnt say wont dismiss cyberpunk large lesson learned reduce space offering far within like real life travel method going point b fun like dying light awesome parkour simply going b process fun immersive music graphic art style like dying light perfect atmosphere plus zombie everywhere kept toe time reason go loot rescue clear safe house horde zombie level gain changing ability dying light yes please tell whats favorite open world outer wild ofc pick direction walk bit run something fun interesting beautiful exploring open world need fun rewarding otherwise whats point need interesting location thing find without becoming ticking thing list hate open world ive explored area realise nothing interest find like loot npc spawn certain place dont think could choose list however could sacrifice story super engaging others great story rarely keep captivated motivated explore open world best open world ive played would stalker anomaly gamma fallout new vega skyrim red dead others played lacking gameplay world bland keep playing long wanting come back experience ability go anywhere see finding whole lot shit couldnt see process world constantly peak curiosity give sense progression tell lem check thing ill quit continue another hour freedom also ability connect character like companion fallout marriage skyrim love feeling meeting character choosing become friend lover without plot point canon pairing going adventure together solo gamer get lonely lol gwent joy fear got valhiems ocean biome wa incredible boat prayer nothing bad happens hard pick going foremost im pretty intolerant towards dead space long transportation distance im sure ive seen ow perfectly iirc daggerfall unity let skip ahead encounter something note wa used wing commander earlier ow decent amount dead space level thats good feature traversal fun see platform adventuremetroidvania good example could longer distance without feature also rather fewer complex interconnected questsmissions living dynamic world dont fill map predetermined point interest check like list chore actually rewarding exploration make comparison often many te open world go dungeon often time copy pasted fight scaled enemy new challenge get end find chest onion gold compare elden ring every dungeon wa challenge unique reward got excited find new place find cool monster ashe new weapon awaits gameplay matter like cause focus total freedom chaotic fun yes addition mod like better bavarium wingsuit give unlimited boost missles nothing better flying around like iron man get money well spent take hour complete massive amount replay ability opposed genre imo location actually unique big biggest downfall recent zelda opinion sure technically lot place find vast majority shrine bokoblin camp little sense discovery fascinating question guess rdr world ton point interest world feel alive incredibly deep sense immersion thing id like immersive sim type method completing mission instead linear way structure really like open world feel truly large lot try convince world massive faction located hundred meter apart think okay open world made much sparser devs put amount content much larger space would immersive would also allow make map bigger without bloating workload also really enjoy area interconnected via environmental storytelling watershed fallout doe great job connectinng different location evidence flooding place lead broken dam another lead base perpetrator story behind event good world building plus kind cosmology mythology see need able visit open world need feel alive possible class great need give feeling life even youre doesnt revolve around like see npcsai character interacting environment without interference random event encounter also big best open world throw unexpected situation encounter travel point b good bunch question mark nothing becomes follow waypoint situation rdr king secret easter egg reward exploring beaten path especially theyre well hidden definitely add sense discovery random generic loot scattered everywhere doesnt count like let interact lot object within environment form life sim aspect like sleeping eating drinking etc bonus help alot roleplaying character finally environmental story telling add sense world feel lived ha history even without definitely freedom immersion also love able interact everything take stuff charm move world boundary able interact everything world feeling getting lost make way world typically without guidance pace deciding direction choice freedom explore interesting thing find worth exploring exploring tedious controversial maybe cant stand dump back final mission credit roll either story end regardless much side content missed preferably make compelling reason stay ending look skyrim dying light dl ha ending make sense go back played finish based experience playing blind without cheating guide spoiler build fun discovering thing getting wowed moment didnt expect learn new thing point combat important progression dislike easy combat super power ability constantly abuse boring book open world requires ability access start without needing go progression system built mean go straight proper armor maybe difficult give access zone prefer grind certain berry buff way without bos gate keeper since mentioned elden ring would categorize open world ha wide room gatekeeper access next room sure branch sub zone within zone clear major zone access require kind key bos structured hierarchy wide zone design thats akin linear choice open total freedom honestly preference varies total freedom let chill selective depending mood done wrong feel like whats point lot constraint feel rewarding accomplishment enjoy rogue like progression save wa annoying defeat way impossible three year grind thats nice limited attempt per day fatal labyrinth something like botw maybe mood wandering around chilling maybe time objective goal depends stress level thing like nintendo also happen oculus hit power button im done press im ready go time ability enter exit fast crucial deciding im going today month dont make controllerkey mapping convoluted enough need relearn decided never finish needed hold large state mind world weapon key binding modifier time get extremely busy week month put easy jump fifteen minute dont remember thing ability need tutorial im side lining indefinitely bench warmer smart level design addictive gameplay vague puzzle fun annoying way repetitive koroks annoying want complete hate koroks theyre filler count bad design acceptable situation ask im really going build different unique mechanic avoid repetition repeated mixed matched brings level fulfilment learned b oh wanted learn accomplish let require b get get orb onto button oh another move orb simulator botw totk overdo put totk worth magic ability cheat dlc cheat anything fun skill based like jumplanding zone get tighter reaction speed slowly increase get stuck metroid dread mario wonderland mario sunshine addictive kind finish skill warmed sunshine forgiving dont start relearn skill story personally care little lore story give enough let use imagination dont bury anything important need know within story explanation im going skip make sequel dont hard code imagination thats issue like zelda show movie alternate reality without core feature like slider thats avoid comic book movie oh want thousand spinoffs thing added value cant get invested alternate version exists contradict thing liked see money grab failing give closure moving going push story need entertaining meet core value give idea never considered like aha moment without bunch overheard im going care like moss id like know little bit story wa excruciatingly wasting precious time skip skip skip ok mouse snake reason story detail much long winded favorite story final fantasy dont remember detail magic gone emperor trying revive take rebel dude took emperor became powerful world destroyed rebuilding prepare final battle epic fight get enough background get stage dont care lizard drinking problem want story id read book wa playing horizon zero dawn horizon forbidden west kept finding climbing mountain particularly wa supposedly map random bebezahnen played german found time night wa magical wanted view wanted see possible ecosystem seeing donnerkiefer distance arriving first carja outpost wa sublime world complex want see complexity happen oddly mean need le specific story didnt really dig holonovels holomovies narrative felt like trying explain culture macro level reading someone evacuated hit likewise dont want map try encompass world city alone hold many many culture bigger world le complexity place get bored searching though design encourages exploring day want story day want go tengent slaughter entire town becuse feel like durability mechanic good story possible gacha either best open world give clear objective player always working toward course best open world completely violate get bored playing best open world give clear objective player always working toward course best open world completely violate personally get bored playing reason still consider first mercenary gold standard open world structuredesign set villainstargets deck card first minute even established hierarchy underling contractor administrator bos ace spade honestly hard pinpoint work definitely say doesnt repetitive scenery copy pasted area area long stretch nothing area starfield really hit nail regard really enjoy rp aspect open world like interacting object enterable building also traveling quantity life feature respect player time take mad max example pretty dull desert setting due empty ishowever driving wa fun didnt care true exploration want able look distance go also want exploration rewarding dont mean sense given something valhalla ha unrewarding exploration mission structure bring every place youve thought found cool hidden temple hour later story lead right odyssey origin x better imo good traversal need good traversal poi close enough matter imo dont like traversal rdr think horse control like shit npc interaction random event make poor traversal make open world feel great whats huge fucking cliff everywhere man invented dynamite reason every setting ha geologically unstable landmass ever scouted shortest route b parabola world design shit feel bad skyrim loz im looking loz get extra middle finger weapon durability thats different discussion utterly nonsense pathing mean mostly gave borderland realized spent time trying figure fuck youre supposed get given mission actually mission last straw wa navigated way around mission marker full around several time could get mission area turn way jumping car landform doesnt remotely look like related nothing ingame give slightest hint even possible let alone required fewer antiqol nuisance exist better disagree th entry world need captivating story bad open world definition proper open world world fully enjoyable sandbox entirely beside main quest objective narrative good open world need organic reward exploration unlike botw find green hill another green hill korok reward nothing real value weapon journey whole second gta san andreas correctly several city lot different type scrub land ton within main environment none gtas gotten part right since wa reason space wa lot discover world animated enough standard time organic encounter occur skyrim sort got right immersion freedom exploration get thing done complete quest got done playing kingdom come deliverance great example brilliant im gon na add point havent seen yet fast travel point travelling distance useful spot really fast travel stupid teleportation spot prime exemle wa baron castle witcher fast travel point tow outside town wa useless wa short enougj hike get actual useful spot really say lot mod added fast travel best designed world exist even without player doesnt affect open world greatly prefer world object arent player interact like trainer pokemon exist player fight le interactable object immersive world player npc interact rather sole reason npc exist need able interact world semifrivolous nonproductive way tavern need able drink pond need able fish spend entirety spaceship need able walk around interact minutia ship give way kick foot drink cup coffee allowenable enjoy life im progressing mainside quest gwent witcher great example factorio maybe satisfactory like drink cup coffee watching work little thing like thing town besides talk dice tavern fish use smith break lock door inoperable scenery door choose would total freedom addictive gameplay story important depending done could really engaging always feeling railroaded exploration obviously deleted liveliness witcher skyrim mystery elden ringbreath wild open world try emulate dont come close theyre losing area fall flat ubisofts open world best example feel like im dying breed gamer kind hate open world greatly prefer purposeful level design dark soul series elden ring despite fairly similar way put honestly mostly aspect really dislike newer zeldas take bethesda example excluding starfield love world design vast majority place make either distinct theme story found either journal letter etc place essence may look generic touched enough feel like arent imo peaked fo aspect take botw dont need many shrine hardly differ aside riddletrial mostly absolutely generic main exception riddle overworld general botw totk feel absolutely barren actually interesting point interest lack distinct place distinct story attached issue industry wide craze making map bigger massive lack thought going individual place stuff becomes generic dont want like totk revolve around finding fun im creative enough get much sandbox everything becomes wider le deep player needing find fun apparently becoming important lack bloat love random event red dead redemption good example could riding along get gunfight bandit help random dude always keep fresh even exploring purpose basically two way make open world day like morrowind zelda elden ring outer wild true freedom exploration liberty choice hand player therefore artificial scaling make world inoffensive level design serf gameplay design intricately tied design whole player charge garden like every single ubisoft ow batman arkham cityinfamous clone mordor spiderman horizon day gone call checklist sole drive linear exploration getting collectible xp put point generic skill tree design make normal exploration useless nothing see besides marker pointed exploration completely parasited hand holding imaginativeintellectual process involved erased result world feel narrow despite size charge player obeys directive like good little dog guess type getting praise award bar pretty low considering really replicate rockstar hate open world look clean cyberpunk included might look stunning screenshots feel artificial doe feel lived city based even zelda botw felt like although understandable totk fixed hate open world often feel like taxi simulator world exploration seamlessly blend gameplay allowing great level immersion skyrim well making explorable world full discoverable location dense interesting flora fauna geographical location observe would say rdr closest world perfect easy get immersed world gameplay king rdr ha best open world ever didnt feel like exploring gameplay bland control awful cyberpunk world isnt detailed lifelike rdr gameplay good varied played hour explored every inch side content rdr example good open world made fromsoftware dont made buy fromsoftware immersive reactive world red dead redemption top incredibly reactive grounded ha great world design interesting captivating world important feature openworld id say option stated would least important feel like theme park want find content fun easier say make shit u since dont many example great openworld honest first maybe important thing include open world immersion open world point optional thing allow dev describe open world story ha promote exploration make exploration break immersion ha character use open world exemple make sense witcher fallout use open world neither regarding story give relatively precise objective theoritical timer character clearly make friend fuck around second point fun provided use open world specific gameplay get open world content optional deep dont think wa worth spent lot time ressources creating open world trying please every audience end disappointing everyone take time make open world make actually useful rush main story cause easily get good gear consummable along way im gon na enjoy taking time explore need feel necessity making interesting get around appreciate beauty world cyberpunk witcher elden ring getting point point b feel like chore whereas spiderman cause prototype make going around world feel incredible give reason open space thats zelda core hahaha complete single mission without least distraction skyrim best point random direction start walking find something new interesting describe lot thing see something higher rest ex tower take attention group bandit attack beautiful scenery left cause path lead cliff simply basic dialogue two npc village fit best agree dont forget handcrafted key word yes totally agree sort mystery le developed narrative base stalker gothic great think wa deadest world played wa sherlock holmes chapter important dont want open world want living world everyone thing found little funny instead getting magic duel villian college quest line suplexed instead able complete main story like min talk feeling like real place talk pure graphic mean scenery feel real even low graphic seeing ai fight randomly always cool see im like shooting star level design term design space explore video help think open world big level outer wild elden ring cyberpunk would say depends youre looking nothing beat explorationdiscovery outer wild elden ring king level design night city best crafted believable space talking strictly design visuals sound architecture atmosphere maybe could add recent zelda aswell havent played seem really interesting mechanic traverse world imo isnt distinctive best always depends preference mean witcher could also called checklist batman spiderman horizon etc pretty well rated received fallout wa actually good many spot environmental storytelling fallout wa actually good many spot environmental storytelling also remember cool looked started raining witcher npc started running hiding roof anything bioware every single ha npc staying place time nothing else every location react nothing also like elden ring war similar entire big open world full enemy would prefer side conflict settlement area control look like actual world like min actually ima answer way also prefer immersion really easy get lost world multiple reason graphic dont necessarily matter certainly help come appreciating way world present visually skyrims graphic dated world still beautiful imo alive world feel large part includes npc behavior ecology general feeling randomness come encounter rdr world really hit home encounter monster hunter superiorly immersive come ecology actual world building lore massive fromsoftware doe good job feeding small bit lore allowing try put piece together elder scroll lore favorite learn fallout lore go deep interesting feeling part something bigger kinda culmination previous point feeling small compared vast world person story told many subnautica really hit home hard bring rdr finally massively overlooked subject music really key ingredient allows feel world im going put skyrim opinion top come ambient track witcher iii music really made feel like wa playing part doom open world perfect example music setting tone video graphic big part however high end graphic arent required good world example minecraft saint row saint row look map city stilwater doesnt seem big however city feel realistic big two reason think existence freeway made city feel bigger actually wa different district poor area rich area industrial zone shopping districtetc made city feel real bigger th generation gta gamesgta vice city san andreas map actually pretty small yet nobody complained city size rockstar designed city seem bigger actually thing make world feel real daynight cycle weather change npcsanimals thing independent player empty space make world better feel real living breathing reality like npc subtle thing would close reality ghost tsushima another seems get overlooked checklist witcher checklist say map ha lot marker turned default since nextgen update basically every quest found organically traveling town notice board main story exploration also find complete nearly every quest without ever talking npc change dialoguecutscene reason goat course also lot encounter found exploring basically come playstyle run every town collect notice board main story maybe doe feel way could opposite blast aswell think great option limited guided playthrough still option freeöy explore everything want fallout bgs got good lot skyrim ha many moment see mini story ah man instantly flashed back mass effect going anywhere felt isolating lol yeah enemy everywhere make want go nowhere think fallout new vega pretty good conflict thing yes think theyre totally uninteresting open world even mechanically loved doesnt make good public prioritizes aspect better story combat even honest far capcom grade stuff mean done newer well turn marker everything exploration outside main quest see everyone ha opinion good cup tea nothing wrong gaming part subjective personally thought botw totk compared size pretty empty exploration got rewarded mostly cheap consumables still good liked doesnt mean theyre good everything sure wont put shortlist exploration reward nobody care korogu nut stuff went found something interesting followed clue got little reward maybe help bit next gameplay segment wasnt empty wa

raiding christian church killing monkspriests funny judaism islam almost never portrayed negatively medium christianity always scrutinized thats wa always disclaimer historically inspired nowhere near historically accurate outrage surrounding theyve claimed certain heavily present aspect historically accurate despite evidence outcry showing case couple culture value tradition honor sincerity responsibility uphold truth important social message think proliferate dlc george washington wa trying become king heaven sake nobody really cared wa obviously work complete fiction didnt try convince

final fantasy vii black character written depth heart purpose wont see many black gamers mad ubisoft wanted credit authentic didnt work thats feel negligent end respectful sazh ff also sad example based higher dont tourist attacking pope want tour japan without malicious intention facing exclusion certain business rising cost entry shrine castle like overall general mistrust yes seems like sensitivity ha real life parallel except nobody ha done obviously released couple day ago suggested fan might damage shrine real life fault video best friend rack would get pretty boring watching fall window time eh feel like wa polite request received small modification doesnt worsen open shrine close visiting tourist mess time think valid fear mischief obscure politician wa discussed japanese diet prime minister japan commented really religion deep root respect shrine generally deceased loved encouraging kid whatnot find disrespectful sadly think answer yes im christian case totally fine

series ha long stopped good idea said hard find punchable pope alexander vi epitaph invited heaven keep either everywhere like create drama rage bait especially xcom twitter generates view click via engagement baiting generate enough get attention think need something part earth care cant another situation whereby ubisofts attempt provide player unlimited choice backfire slightly provided truly great destruction physic affect area unfortunately could also affect shrine area therefore player could choose japan concerned copy behaviour real life reality french teach actual history yeah let destroy whatever want like nothing sacred consequence hold thought peak border hey usa guy everything okay probably response wanting actually sell number lot current decision favor doubt ubisoft would

ezio climbing top cross basilica back ejecting priceless fresco depicting jesus today probably would backlash got dont mean invalidate japan concern im saying may reason culture different im sure last thing want dipshit foreigner like logan paul johnny somali disrespecting historic landmark french tbf french believe difference depiction church valhalla generic whereas shrine depicted real life shrine japanese parliament live stream japanese prime minister wa complaining real life going shrine depicted messing ha nothing christian religious depiction le outrage whatever youre trying insinuate ever add new plus valhalla loved wan na goddammit starting scratch bros still going paying kharmic debt heat death universe wasnt direct comparison used example simply japan would offended still see temple infested centipede demon fighting monk etc wa made japanese developer didnt quite stroke outrage locally im opinion need chill obviously defacing monument real world insane stifling

mediacitizens unwarranted obviously suck clown deface anything think outrage surrounding wa fueled occurances even though destructible object environment really big deal something intentionally done disrespect japan im commenting isnt stupid news headline japan simply say tourist defacing shrine resonate whether concern valid destructible environment way doe yeah valhalla ha indestructible church burn pillage soon protagonist literally insult jesus christ backlash wa unnecessary think honest square enix contrary ubisoft doesnt talk historical accuracy remember ok long western culture theyre evil east dont understand cultural appropriation racism xenophobia tbf dont think black white isnt becaue ubisoft said research culture thing ubisoft proved otherwise didnt also get trouble using logo

culture like jhonny somali ha much contribution video shit always shit regardless excuse thsy rheynwill find another rack man never felt disrespected great country mah racka might point personally think would far worse somebody like logan paul hypothetically filmed going shrine vandalizing anyone publicizes something like engagement glorifying behaviour encouraging bit le concerning incidental mechanic video since content creator stream themself smashing ingame shrine would likely prompt player repeat behaviour rather bust real shrine however also tend much faith humanity well maybe polite im saying unnecessary change ubis part comment come assumption activity lead real world violence destruction typically isnt thing example yakuza sub often showing picture real life area depicted well known destruction often real life place japan going japan mess thing thats someone intent thats causing doubt japanese beyond random vandalism may occur concur article ubi probably concerned

asian male ie represented western medium western source constantly pushed aside race thought japanese perspective different asian living west japanese japan arent aware minority experience arent minority country get almost exclusive representation japanese medium different perspective result different criticism japanese native seem concerned historical accuracy perspective japanese american nine month flinging excuse wall see stick ha become identity doe highlight thing doe care much coward say asian actually yall favorite race post address question difference type level inaccuracy im clearly buying doe simply bringing issue wa distinguishing concern white protagonist european setting playing black female protagonist doesnt upset asian male exclusion western medium upset got step right direction dont think discrimination pointless topic thanks concern im japanese american wouldnt first whine yasuke using chagpt tell u dont give fuck asian men yet love exploitinf asian culture without tellin u check history pathetic wa real excuse youre using historical accuracy justification seemingly discriminatory decision making male face japan african disingenuous use historical accuracy shield brush fictional story completely inaccurate portrayal get pointed bothered read post youd see yasukes depiction nothing like explicit detail record departure reality nothing like inaccuracy previous nature scope unprecedented inexplicable length ubisoft taking shoehorn wishfullyrevised historical figure incapable stealth parkour protagonist make seem like discrimination openly opposed segregative propaganda good person moral duty completely different telling someone engage video decided begin employing hypocritical ideology already mentioned shes positive difference listed post illustrate baffling breaking serieslong theme precedent ubisoft enacted exclude asian male protagonist first mainline set east asia got bring discrimination light time cup tea seems perpetuating long history marginalizing asian men western medium society discrimination often go unnoticed brushed point bring light ignorance insensitive malicious hallmark disingenuous argument doe nothing hide nioh made japanese dev obviously arent discriminating asian men considered maybe japan fucking powerhouse video production make shitload video featuring asian men protagonist therefore asian men absolutely underrepresented video need focus subset western cry lack asian man representation ever since trailer came last may amount comment history arent dedicated whining counted hand thing vocal thing doesnt believe check history throughline anything genuine guy bad actor weird youve posting topic relentlessly month lol honestly valid reason yasuke protagonist personally upset degree feel strongly bad look imo maybe take hint cant imagine shogun also based real featured nioh actually basically idea william based handful white merchantoutcast landed stayed japan handful actually given samurai title williamis loosely based onenot directly yasuke similar boat real person story loosely based wa retainer wa paid equivalent like wa samurai never title changed oda offed ever happened basically every retelling sengoku period regardless whose telling tends tell romanticized version based actual general figure period tend never outright historically accurate loosely accurate would odd thing japanese person made account creepy weird black character video bother month old opinion talk therapist man almost like video dont follow type rule want come head got templar got even thing went action stealth rpg mechanic went solo dual protagonist went male able choose gender went playable third person character present day first person character none back playable third person character franchise change see fit writer wanted story yasuke whats issue dual protagonist seriously style historical character theyve done three time directly anastasia romanova russia jack ripper syndicate leonidas odyssey many time directly inspired historical figure also considering nonplayable character make major historical figure protagonist change story time concern historical accuracy messing real make zero sense face ubisoft specifically searching black person japan idk man complaint really boil historical figure wa white asian wouldnt backlash going historical protag eventually honestly im surprised didnt happen sooner yasuke nice fit given outsider status tie nobunaga templar thats even writing anything new nothing forced decided make impossibly huge giant opened gameplay footage check like three inch taller guard standing next man reality wa fuck talking impossibly huge objectively made goddamn ogre even fan didnt even realize strongly leaning baseless damaging stereotype like really hope recognize ridiculous right yeah recognize almost funny ridiculous men see black man standing next asian man call direct attack race treating asian men like child taller thats incredibly revealing sad random black dude going japan wouldnt naturally tower every person like child grew japan yes many foreign men black men towered head crowd time even mother wa considered short country origin wa considered tall japanese standard today different japan eats beef food contribute height past yasuke inch taller make racist challenge masculinity asian men general pretty clear ubisoft made fictional yasuke main character cater sense diversity matter handful western country usually driven white guilt know really telling gamergate simply keep ignoring basic capitalist profit driven motif diversity inclusion making attack white nationalist value dont think ubisoft particularly noble motive making character someone larger male american audience wa likely connect japanese woman think could certainly criticize unfortunately existence black men story inherently attack asian masculinity critique im going join bullshit thomas lockley wrote book obscure historical figure whose popularity already rise year beforehand lockley responsible yasuke japan upset racist scapegoat invented push narrative black cant popular unless white man responsible infantilizing japanese saying historical community solely reliant wikipedia source also make physical sense true japan ha produced yasukerelated medium since wikipedia existed could tell thomas lockley timetraveling criminal mastermind claim make would still make sense part outright lie point would also note made zero effort logically connect even true ha anything discrimination doubt pointing prior depict open deviation major event history going make shut offensive black man im japanese american dont know grew japan consider culture race gender attack see fictional video black man japan would point insecurity worth addressing therapy dont know asian find called asian offensive thats said either know lying bad faith struggling basic reading said describing specific complaint japanese culture history based time place making attack asian identity word trying coopt specific cultural concern without specific wrong fictional work making point race im talking asian representation youve propping something marginalised find offensive well let gaming brothersisterhood know isnt problem türkiye opinion isnt türkiye japan japan youll back claim u understand definition reason behind isnt personally dont care enzo part put isnt turkish im happy asian culture represented properly ha long time gaming false wont even say thomas lockleys name lest google find wrong well every western set

op doe give fuck asian men nothing convenient excuse post segregative propaganda employing hypocritical ideology good person oh yeah fix right away well start first racist clear bias shown start correcting well start asian country marginalizing everyone else except asian remember japan didnt lose war japan army long history asian country founding western civilization oh wait fit bill doesnt asian representation asian everywhere want thing maybe accept country base content primary population stop ignorant tldr dont two crap give hypocritical self serving behavior thats thing work writeup showa american story chinese dev making japanese person texas criticize capcom putting japanese national man middle hawaii yakuza literally go history capcom decide character street fighter go history stereotype could comment conveniently pick character black know thats like saying hollywood racism black nigeria pumping ton movie yearly black cast thats like saying asian mc represented entertainment industry korea japan china fucking powerhouse entertainment production make shitload movie tv show music sport program featuring asian men woman protagonist matter fact indian represented either look representation bollywood similarly nigerian look representation nollywood issue asian male representation western medium look real issue ubisoft western medium developer japanese medium deal heavily cliche trope im judging fact medium preference trope ninja samurai martial artist overwhelmingly majority protagonist honorbound stoic isnt necessarily based reality idealized image type character onesided portrayal fine japan shortage diversity personality type rest medium west overwhelming majority japanese medium consumed onesided portrayal particular martialartist personality type becomes problematic ive literally tell japanese honorable stoic interesting protagonist ridiculous think group even samurai conception probably based medium consumed ubisoft opportunity create different type japanese samurai couldve positive still authentic chose make male face japan african instead pointing racism side globe antiasian sentiment thread insane actually popular sentiment asian community dont gaslight entire race expert dont know man feel like asian men legitimate gripe generally portrayed western medium often treated lower priority diversity conversation initiative understand japaneseamerican might frustrated huge franchise finally choosing historical japan setting making choice male main character japanese dont think hard understand member asian community feel slighted without accusing racist imagine might upset well made ancient north american tribe chose shipwrecked viking lead instance discrimination doe upset personally admit banned blocked repeatedly speaking ha made want speak hint legitimate discussion even possibility asian discrimination allowed thats impression wa getting yeah bet youre selfconscious asian person irish whiskey keep enabling antiasian racism issue lack asian male representation western medium issue ubisoft forgoing perfect opportunity create positive prominent representation asian male character exploit japanese culture change mentioned didnt conflict hidden history aspect thats core series identity since beginning series ha always whatif secrethistory fantasy complete rewriting history happens open without stealth fantasy admit character cant stealth barely parkour baffling stupid decision make missing two three core aspect lead pretty fucking gross ubisoft everything power avoid male asian protag heard rumor single black dude may may existed latched onto pretty racist got ta honest never liked change made franchise everything syndicate real even syndicate wa barely edge proper unity wa buggy mess black flag wa good also barely real didnt really many quite mad time understandably shouldnt even fourth ended franchise barely even assassinating newer anymore valhalla wield literaly hammer thor ermm excuse werent hidden blade really cool kill secret isnt weapon like literal opposite killing stood anymore fighting set historical scenario change like drifting even away franchise past year make yasuke king japan care maybe evil templar trying control japan eliminate minion final bos something dont make u historical figure also jack ripper wa dlc leonidas wa opening sequence didnt like particularly either also said nothing historical accuracy implementing known notable black person feel like uhh guuuyss making new time japan need black person go track uh alright let make playable character get gist also didnt want say forcing black u like ubisoft trying forcefully add black add black even somewhat ridiculous oh care could actually make main character black give good backstory maybe lost brother yasuke yasuke high ranking guy portugese evil templar trying gain control japan yasuke find brother teach way awesome right main protagonist mainline v temporary protagonist short prolog dlcs spinoff disingenuous comparison would equally upset protagonist wa white would genuinely love zulu kingdom two black protagonist would feel zulu kingdom starred wishfullyrevised version historical white figure attack white nationalist value attack japanese culture culture masculinity yasuke doe represent japanese samurai sengoku jidai simply fiction made white man without profound evidence later western company took cater idea diversity mean token racial character every story hanzō wanted insert historical figure famous ninja ninja japanese version dont deny profit driven also part culture built around development studio completely valid criticism trying pas racial supremacy issue fact white men rewritting history culture rich country cared combating white supremacy wouldnt defend discrimination prejudicial treatment based race prejudicial treatment essentially unusual treatment usually negative like exclusion popular medium point illustrate unusual treatment first mainline set east asia getting dont find black men offensive find skipping opportunity prominent asian male role western exploit asian culture offensive given long history asian male representation western medium maybe grew japan dont seem understand growing country medium demeaning community werent outright excluding apologize misinterpreted word admit japanese setting offensively keep describing asian continent culture revealing race issue sound nothing like clarification race issue discrimination often genuinely sounded like saying offensive include japanese broader asian race accusing lying bad faith questioning basic reading skill revealing deleted japanese american im actually asian ive watched western medium marginalize asian men life google real issue asian male representation western medium think im virtue signaling think ubisoft continuing long history discrimination whether theyre aware theyre ive explained detail dont speak asian neither knew anything series youd know revelation set turkey wa obviously intended turkey wa intended sendoff ezio massively popular protagonist like said turkey wa simply backdrop made sense ezio avoided boringness three row set italy aside ghost tsushima realize point little asian male lead created westerner right realize actual asian male born raised west inclined representation like every white black man asian male get pushed aside western gaming industry racism funny love asian culture couldnt give two shit racial hierarchy asian men lastly wouldnt tell black folk another funny quite racist dismiss asian men love benefitting asian culture dont care consulted end result western us japanese culture breaking serieslong precedent include asian male protagonist yes thats offensive since asian growing west wa made wellaware exposed western medium demeaning excluding asian men life think described detail discussing whether something discrimination isnt pointless topic yes racism discrimination exist everywhere world talk issue homelessness u without first solving bigger homelessness part world allowed address specific discrimination community part world argument ridiculous dont seem understand definition hypocrisy isnt edit youre allowed focus issue feel important whatever reason want talk issue representation asian country go ahead id probably agree doe talking representation west seem bother much series ha specific history theme precedent surrounding thats different yakuza street fighter showa american story whatever different context different assessment picked talk series like broke serieslong theme precedent include asian male protagonist first mainline entry east asia saying character black disingenuous mischaracterization imo though setting probably reason first protagonist completely incapable stealth well yeah mean except chinese indian nigerian movie dont typically make western audience unlike japanese video rest well represented someone understands thanks couldnt said better something posted sure maybe id still disagree premise whatever posting nearly year different way basically justify opinion black protagonistbad simply insane good faith way lol legitimate gripe know op really complaining comment history display openly discrimination yasuke protagonist though pretty clearly dont like black lol youve thought nearly year point youre working many gymnastics often try make seem valid get approval maybe first learn definition discrimination start posting thing anyway discrimination nah isnt legitimate discussion isnt legitimate discussion youre salty antiwoke weirdo cant stand feature black man dude post history going back year noting im irishjapanese grown japan youre racist troll watermelon name pretending care culture arent part simply take insecure fear black lol youre racist black get main protagonist mainline v temporary protagonist short prolog dlcs spinoff disingenuous comparison completely lose sight talking triggered black man japanese set consider attack asian masculinity already pointed none first claim even matter conclusion reason offended factually untrue icing cake mean seriously claim believe well wouldnt racist made princess anastasia protagonist mainline since part chronicle series guess black man existence racist make feel emasculated would feel zulu kingdom starred wishfullyrevised version historical white figure seem keep erasing existence female japanese protagonist complaint comparison let say make zulu white figure black figure could switch complaint would involve existence black men next white direct attack masculinity racism white mere presence big black men next race demeaning emasculating race revealing statement made conclusion wrong reason discrimination prejudicial treatment based race right like example claiming character emasculating demeaning marginalizing asian men black point illustrate unusual treatment first mainline set east asia getting factually wrong find skipping opportunity prominent asian male role western since existence female japanese lead make whole argument based racial representation moot dismiss relevant argument even though logic every western starring asian woman discriminatory towards asian men dont seem understand growing country medium demeaning community sympathetic argument demeaning treatment exclusion lack representation yes understand repeat ive said time issue specifically treating fact black emasculating asian men making bunch argument irrelevant point open honest feel way conversation want critical ubisoft reason including yasuke psychologically revealing feeling emasculation something share ive interest pretending gamergate movement pushing issue based concern diverse representation historical accuracy basically many different turkic tribe throughout history migrated various reason altai mountain inner mongolia still live inter mingled mongol russian slavic chinese eventually changed nomadic tribe settled group oghuz turk tribe settled türkiye inter mingled greeksarabspersian group within region time oghuz tribe settled flourished family called osmanli developed later became ruling family started west call ottoman empire many dynasty specific turkic tribe many others existed still exist majority would contained turkish greek jewish christian group especially time specific wa set famous important city like istanbul nobody made claim argue send ezio convinced arent represented japanese asian person wish day change bro think isnt western made dont asian lead character youre far say asian american thing argue movie business tends antiasianbecause kinda group video get stuff like sifu parisian dev group making new unique chinese main character got short secret level recently got greenlit become entire series way asian lead think far cry prey jade empire sleeping dog mark ninja warrior etc youre upset black character thats classic japanese anti black racism edit shadowbanned cant reply would say could far cry obscure jade empire obscure ignored point equivalent telling black person different different core complaint thread developed west need asian protagonist else racist many set africa many black protagonist small fraction set asia asian protagonist many set japan many asian protagonist anything asian setting asian protagonist represented youre cherry picking ahh many asian set developed western country take place tues character hold flashlight priced dollar asian male protagonist oh racist racism real racism youve faced real every problem life dislike racism sus youre happens black man asia cant help suspect systemic asian anti black racism inherently racist star character japanese doesnt look japanese japan ha long recorded history anti black racism dont remark perpetuate stereotype specific discrimination let get brass tax asian make u population ever think maybe youre represented proportionally know dont get dont get come history ancestor came place wa u else come point go enough attention u disgusting top large number japanese western themed western main character many actual japanese aaa asian male lead many ancient japan setting kdrama getting popular west represents culture korean west east asian sizable percentage population western country need represented western gamemovie studio western produced ha asian male lead isnt kungfu samurai ninja crap related asian gang activity prey main guy corpo scientist good ole hollywood alien experiment tried post total time post werent locked course year seems weirder try police much minority allowed care portrayed medium explicitly say issue isnt protagonist black protagonist japanese im sure would accuse saying black protagonist bad seems wild make racist statement attribute someone different minority group didnt say detract concern cultural representation tell ua dont give fuck asian men without telling u yet yall love benefitting asian culture case point ha op never spoken discrimination allegedly care outside yasukes portrayal ha adamantly refused every time ha prompted even read post yasuke protagonist instead japanese samurai youd expect based precedent set make seem like discrimination asian men western medium ha perpetrating medias history long ive bringing point irrelevant whether point true keep bring validation approval clearly still dont get comment prove point asian issue get easily dismissed part medium representation western medium portrays asian men npc western society tends treat discrimination face marginalized brushed definition think marginalization asian men throughout western medias history isnt discrimination argue ubisoft continuing history go series precedent deny protagonist role asian men us culture really happens op resort flinging hollow excuse wall see stick cant accept none ever dont think black man japanese set attack asian masculinity think marginalizing asian men exploit culture dont feel emasculated feel community issue face marginalized first claim illustrate unusual treatment first mainline getting discrimination prejudicial treatment based race prejudicial treatment essentially unusual treatment usually negative like exclusion popular medium shouldve included main mainline none claim otherwise untrue argument still stand imo dont keep erasing existence female japanese protagonist complaint specifically mention post said im happy asian woman represented naoe thats irrelevant point think protagonist zulu kingdom black would much outrage werent honest think outrage would justified complaint would involve existence black men next white direct attack masculinity racism white mere presence big black men next race demeaning emasculating race said nothing sort mischaracterization revealing willingness read carefully reading comprehension level good faith discussion right like example claiming character emasculating demeaning marginalizing asian men black emasculating demeaning marginalizing asian men discrimination found much western medias history african male representative japan discrimination found imo youre mischaracterizing word seems like bad faith missing point factually wrong ive edited post add mainline main protagonist point thats youre referring factual error regardless think argument still stand repeat ive said time issue specifically treating fact black emasculating asian men thats im saying clarify dont think emasculating asian men simply perpetuating western medias history marginalizing bring emasculation provide context broader discrimination towards asian men ubisoft may based decision whether consciously unconsciously thought referencing revelation starring turkish protagonist initial comment apologize misunderstood im convinced western medium ha history marginalizing asian men think ubisoft perpetuating marginalization discrimination east asian men particular dont think misunderstood seemed casually dismiss genuine concern real issue feigned virtue signaling based nothing casual dismissal issue pertain group consequence marginalization popular medium part imo wish day thing change group marginalized problem rarely change unless problem first acknowledged addressed really arent many either think fair include movie show discussion asian male representation western medium admit thing definitely gotten better recent year like say sifu ghost tsushima decade marginalization make think taking step backward skipping perfect opportunity positive asian male representation highprofile exploiting asian culture shadowbanned far cry isnt obscure almost never see protags face dont far cry dont know doe even talkhave personality yes id consider jade empire obscure ive never heard im probably higher end gamer spectrum ask friend theyve heard regardless compared franchise obscure mark ninja warrior sleeping dog rare example prominent positive representation asian men western medium following copy pasta response another comment answer point many set japan japanese medium deal heavily cliche trope im judging fact medium preference trope ninja samurai martial artist overwhelmingly majority protagonist honorbound stoic isnt necessarily based reality idealized image type character onesided portrayal fine japan shortage diversity personality type rest medium west overwhelming majority japanese medium consumed onesided portrayal particular martialartist personality type becomes problematic ive literally tell japanese honorable stoic interesting protagonist ridiculous think group even samurai conception probably based medium consumed ubisoft opportunity create different type japanese samurai couldve positive still authentic chose make male face japan african instead racism post describes detail seems like ubisoft continuing western medias undeniable history exclusion marginalization asian men deflect want japan inclusive asian men youre completely ignoring argument isnt sus ubi broke multiple serieslong theme precedent first mainline set east asia replace asian male record id equally upset wa william adam instead yasuke dont care black care male face japan isnt japanese reach far back time name obscure name six many come etc also conveniently ignored point wouldnt tell black person another zulu kingdom replaced lead white guy would tell black person gta implying yasuke wa japanese even ubisoft claim specifically said wanted nonjapanese character eye interview quote thats since deleted probably sound like subtle racism type asian west typically face yasuke japanese african understood little japanese probably spent total year japan youre completely honest record explicit fault almost certainly lived life isolation zero freedom entire time japan dont think racist acknowledge acknowledging historical racism neither racist perpetuating really way get past imo western country long recorded history antiasian antiasian male racism get yall dont give fuck asian men surprising yall ostracize asian men western society trying put fake face yall care argument place looking back dont think even read post im asking historical accuracy im asking disproportionately increased representation asian western medium im asking asian male representation western exploit asian culture dont think thats unreasonable ask especially asian representation western medium isnt even proportionate brass tax number asian make u population make larger percentage specific field instance make personnel u medical industry reflected prominent role u doctor drama medium focused hospital never mind big name japanese devs better track record creating nonjapanese protagonist especially set west population u actually diverse world second point ignores fact country history u else logic world get talk discrimination ever seem chip shoulder asia history go make topic id probably agree many point telling go something else instead simply discussing possibility discrimination affect community west ridiculous quite frankly disgusting yeah uh whole point wa true doesnt actually mind black protagonist would passionately upset year lol would expect come right say clear action actually time actually insane amount post lol thats ha left policing point bad look op doe give fuck asian men culture bro give rest god lmao dont think black man japanese set attack asian masculinity youre used term topic thread past thread keep harping point wa something else might agree fact list ha nothing discrimination emasculation trying really thread needle claim something unique treatment historical fiction show arent engaging substantively defending emasculation part complaint prejudicial treatment essentially unusual treatment usually negative like exclusion popular medium okay already pointed repeatedly argument character inclusion wouldnt racist hadnt made russia chronicle count dlc make zero sense know dont believe find technical reason different aspect doesnt make racist dont keep erasing existence female japanese protagonist thats irrelevant point thing im saying dont mention im pointing youre ignoring erasing

ubisoft purpose aquire share ubisoft guillemot family response guillemot allied tencent sold large amount stake prevent takeover crmcbecause tencent interested actually making video isnt going strip mine company selling ip highest bidder like crmc ha expressed interest guillemot however point cant risk selling stake tencent crmc ha initiated proceeding oust yves guillemot ceo unless somehow magically improve stock performancethat crmc process shorting acquiesce demand liquidate company pivot live service business direction guillemot made prevent last hostile takeover attempt almost decade fighting hostile takeover ha driven ceo decision making instead deciding whats healthy company ubisoft uniquely bad position cant even make decision statistic even whats beneficial ubisoft keep making decision seem like self sabotage thats fight inside company may looking end fight pretty soon issue half open world player dont even reach half way achievement rate drop like bloated mindless boring quest fluff drop new came like believe data showed never finish valhalla iteration past like blackflag way much ha time another land next year curare questing much memorable le fluff polished story like ghost tshushima something similar felt incredibly repetitive every quest wa exactly isnt mmo want solid story pretty graphic art team hold look incredible today use talent great story polished miningful quest dont shit ubisoft making open world shit making feeling open world new skin every goddamn year incompetent nothing end powerful position nintendo shame turning zelda completely different little relation series typical gameplay appeal modern kid monetizing ip ubisoft could ip well saying someone hated zelda botw understands worked commercially well besides switch worthwhile compete especially time aaaa gaming actually never let ubisoft live aaaa comment big feel really see vast complete really full triple quadruplea deliver long run ubisofts ceo talking disaster making skull bone yeah indie almost exclusively im fun im fairly wealthy oldhead money concern gog ha way better economica sonynintendo store man cant tell enough much love playing example noita even terrarium darn day stalker wa pretty hyped ubisoft else triple day except baby anno love anno mean integrate live service pretty good helldivers space marine example fomo rush pass kind dumb mtx let feel scammed see like diablo costed fucking battle pas skin shop cant losing hope lust especially like diablo normally reward hard challenge impossible drop chance cool item armor transmogs ever see ubisoft fall others follow downfall im excited battlefield release describes ubisoft well huge map packed generic repetitive task easy mass produce deliver best cost content rationale player studio bland outdated imo used love old havent even looked like decade every person buy someone doesnt wont buy buy might reign support type give single player experience please good player bos rush mod also start preprofessional level school dev student prepared say least come office hour barely code senior year okay though school ha class using ai development code csswe student dont want dev salary realize youre saying article gamers spending ⅓ le wildlands division first pc delved gaming played gtas nfss theyre still best pc gaming experience ive still copy start finish time time suck decision made led like think make mean really tried course retain staff well lmao im pretty sure know wildlands good screw around coop good varied setting breakpoint trash wont going back ghost recon think played demo beta immediately could tell wa garbage buddy preordered wa person know else wanted obv reason like friend group loved wildlands lost crown wa financial failure despite good even far cry wa far cry elephant saw money flowing thought quickly let make another jump fc fc wa insane rest fc new map quirky feature chance great political commentary fc chickened mean look soundtrack youtube read comment particularly keep rifle side close making strong statement instead made completely generic forgettable irony integral quote perfectly explains idiocy ubisoft following release ever told definition insanity thing expecting shit change valhalas modern day plot wa good many didnt reach long wa ubisoft ha make shorter concise event set piece le open world fluff would go long way think thats quite exaggeration good acb acr extremely well written despite gameplay hiccup innovative acbf still popular unity detailed beautiful city bug fixed seen best syndicate also good branched lot way origin totally revitalised formula odyssey basically witcher greece really remotely bad entry valhalla still sold incredibly well rogue often even considered main line steam banned ad last week gon na ban launcher ubisoft wa interested buying last year new prince persia metroidvania even waiting egs exclusivity end launched steam uplay complete nonstarter made good pc port without uplay requirement id bought since refuse theyll never get money thats mirage bought sale month later thats actually worth say company oh rdr gta similar gameplay shared asset elder scroll fallout prince persia ever really well often liked critic player base simply isnt bad dont think making single good enough get side year year fuckup well side scroll jump run really kind called mario anyway even dont sell kind volume ubisoft need need big production like last year avatar sw outlaw completely knock park somewhere decent meh isnt gon na sway tired ubisoft anymore besides issue actually selling production pipeline fucked beyond reasonable degree developer working valhalla instance thats call duty number recoup cost need sell call duty volume thats realistic seem fundamental problem develop begin thats causing completely unsustainable didnt even know released new prince persia like either go marketing development really good like say im interested bought agree wa fantastic imo reason didnt sell well hardly actual advertising suck team worked prince persia got canned didnt sell well enough shocked changed look like college student made questionable call good massive market scroll bad track record wa really putting plus barely heard see marketing new prince persia many year reputation yeah im confused sell doesnt take account previous pop part existing community fan base tbh im fan new style pop wa butchered check developer comment moved mechanic priority etc le interpret trying say make good instead making make money like balatro example simple super cheap yet got nominated goty fun ever matter making used extreme example lol mean multiple considered masterpiece like cant dont care way wrong enjoying every need soulslike deep story driven rpg ubisoft light weight made player know exactly want think ubisofts biggest issue stagnation making every iteration slight variation increasing cost dont see difference enjoying enjoying cod battlefield sport sniper elite soul love come metro wolfenstein doom zelda little le sandbox super hero borderland diablo much ip ubisoft becoming punching bag stagnant industry ha never bad main line fair ubisoft remarkably consistent according google k employee averange salary france according google euro thats salary alone obviously math isnt totally correct since lot staff isnt french might lower salary also without doubt paid lot might even yeah think reason like tactical shooter arent really others p know tried odyssey cause p quit hour cause didnt even feel like generic open world run yellow dot map filler garbage mmm thats better try mouth open happier laughed hard lol actual rumour tencent way guillermot tanking intentionally always done incompetent touch cycle like small studio make good limited scope get bought bigger company get lot funding make good sequel feature content big company attempt make series corporate cash cow several sequel stumble door worse last mean example opposite well dma design wa basically lemming got bought company eventually become know today rockstar north ubisoft hasnt small company since rayman absolutely exactly gamingindustryspecific issue though boeing seems going something similar rn business tank eventually manager primarily educated economics longer touch expert run show cant make product without capital probably lot manager dont attract attention competent think good ubisoft probably done ubisoft wa already huge ubisoft wa also never bought still headed original founder something unique western company ubisoft challenge lot complicated loudmouth nongamer executive somehow suddenly appeared company yes wont get without major downsizing yes decade since ubisoft wa small company never truly bought others even couple tried ubisoft wa small far cry came ubisoft ha massive company since released many great since isnt problem ubisoft problem guimots however spell long grown fat stubborn leading constant rehashing already tired idea awesome quote loved deleted bethesda never doe thing twice always thing dumbed much somehow work farcry arent bad repetitive liked primal got bored midway didnt even finish wonder ubisoft seems like punching face theyre civil war ubisofts ip auctioned sound fantastic ea next fairness many like regardless open world even absolutely amazing see drop around half way point even hour long see drop dont attention span something anymore buy get half way buy new repeat heck never even launch stats common lot gamesfor example elden ring erdtree sold bunch copy le gamers even beat

vendor especially big name vendor client name know jagex epic activision take ubisoft ea microsoft launcher require pissing even small number alone except jagex solid way get kicked last century term revenue dont see valve becoming production company replace others yeah ip ha hype behind original big wa successful franchise p havent done much since perception ubisoft bad rn even good leery buy sadly im inclined agree brand problem point struggling correct didnt mario wonder fine tbh released like trailer wa terrible youre wrong v good metroidvania trailer wa amazingly bad idea like wow sell million copy literally time nintendo either pop ha done multiple time across franchise reinventing telling new story ip isnt bad thing thats got sand time first place terrible keep remaking also terrible reinvent ip fresh new addition like acac naval stuff maybe could considered really really good masterpiece bit stretch opinion issue ha always management developer company shown talent suck get stifled much churn copy paste blandness havent cared since black flag farcry died well current title still solid enough easy see sell except skull bone never shit every aspect dear lord

historicallyaccurate deleted equipped weapon two ability restrictive previous rpgs allowed player ranged ability melee ability equipped time looking forward playing even though still havent played valhalla yet may im interested playing something ignore dont engage anything im interested quite simple ive never nerd rage urge something fail dont like thats sad unstable behavior reason consider person would never call gamer whole culture becoming toxic embarrassing dont want anything especially something dont care nobody hate reddit gamer like opening pandora box valhalla sold well apparently better youd think thats sign franchise becoming popular think mostly arent many viking mind youd think longtime fan requested setting japan would also gamers ready jump im sure weve stellar experience ghost tsushima release ha sequel coming year rise ronin another set hit pc month thing better ha last year better combat better stealth better experience ha successful wa tackling time

discourse culture war grifter nutjobs youtubers kill mean based last preview pretty much cant stealth yasuke parkour limited compared naoe cant even climb synchronization point ha brutal assassination super loud basically reveals every nearby enemy far stealthy way seems focus bow snipe pretty weird would completely rework stealth system playable character cant interact example sound darkness important separate stealth difficulty slider much better enemy ai higher difficulty season affect environment ie winter pond get frozen cant swimdive fall leaf fall tree bush cant hide rain muffle sound much louder without revealed tbh handled multiple character really well syndicate tbh time get reddit youre priming disappointment youre going experience something decide whether like youre building anxiety thinking way bad ready zero anything bad without experiencing could fun different mean thats point feel like contrast matter playstyles different stop worrying fear think thats point though origin changed made stealth obsolete charge legendary gear fight whole fort theyre giving option character continue playing like youve played newer go character line classic focus stealth shouldve made samurai like since origin cant fully commit large rpgs want make without forcing side dont see point two character exactly want brawler want stealth fear seems like whiny statement make hasnt come like doesnt make sense small bad combat big bad stealth theyre supposed different thats literally point making two character otherwise would alexioskassandra situation enter every cautious

viking new rpg sold like gang buster ha sold previous itits online circlejerk dying franchise valhalla sold well apparently better youd think thats sign franchise becoming popular think mostly arent many viking valhalla also released back two critically acclaimed origin odyssey sort captive audience covid said looking like potentially best franchise thing better ha last year better combat better stealth better experience disagree stealth look like going deeper stealth either two overall experience im optimistic based weve seen well see honestly think oddessy valhalla would done lot better didnt call like jad idea call mythology something word lol ghost tsushima stealth literally dogshit though feel badass super barebones enemy braindead ever also got world got stale fast far cry since almost city big historical building would say got got praised melee combat cinematic artstyle otherwise better average wished wa remake new rune like first ragnar wa awesome stuff supposedly stealth robust better stealth tsushima tsushima better overall thing better ha last year better combat better stealth better experience combat ha never really thing also heck got rotr make feel like sneaky recent deleted dont like character thing fact cant certain thing forcing go menu change character climb tower example everything else ubisoft last wa mirage comment paint exact picture ubisoft failing lately chuds believe woke design recycling gameplay mechanic whatever truth ubisoft burned aaa title go deep discount month launch get want sell lot expected recoup mtx wouldve worked generally bugfree experience top generally buggy release pretty much mean zero incentive buy dayone ubisoft noone blame got didnt scratch parkour stealth interesting worldcharacters itch usually scratch got top

day day life bustling city etc calling nutjobs saying dont like preview make bad opinion whatever make feel better lmao mean would cool played like gta could run ran distraction yasuke drawing attention guard away target push button instantly switch naoe sneak ai control yasuke thats good know didnt hope go well always worry alot fo advertising ha stealth samurai brawling love get try stealth fail start throwing hand really really hope good loved origin odyssey found valhalla bit boring england uninteresting destination hoping great concern course either character could perform task jacob might better brawling carriage driving perk evie might get great stealth perk path barred based playing time dividing thing pretty hard samurai cant parkour well cant fit feudal japanese air vent stealth takedown loud alerting everyone go return crazy powerful tank able onemanarmy though mission different style im sure look good guess see nah character lore lol basically plot explanation choosing preference male female didnt jacob evie played almost identically used weapon exclusive skill end skill tree meaning played practically im glad character actually differently start didnt mission jacob exactly also solves choice paralysis problem extent knowing character flat better certain situation another make choosing character basic question maximize success activity theyre supposed different thats literally point making two character issue simply yasuke cant parkour apparently oneshot build archery forced main character wa skeptical odyssey ended favorite tweaked setting lol dont think ubi care still fool paying might thought shouldve brought originality instead internet drama video peak entertainment maybe find proper productive hobby op paid account majority

misrepresented many actually comment replying hour old minute old time writing think maybe poster different experience thread time writing comment ive semiheavily downvoted comment chain cautiously optimistic berated another gently correcting someone misconception assassination going work angry even yet edit theyre literally stalking profile reply every time leave comment lol record yes misunderstood assassination work deliberately ignoring fact exact thing want already option admit right prove point though agree assassination would literally impossible regular enemy would wild assumption make would problematic health even case still option make assassination guaranteed instakill also angry directed crowd general single person combination kid following discourse sad adult wan na see ubisoft burn unhealthy degree kid also probably bunch sad angry men figure dislike franchise ha become mean depressing life mental gymnastics statement certainly amusing ive following since first grew tired recycled time unity released didnt finish origin released gave try turn hated rpg element older gameplay didnt finish gave final try odyssey finally gave took polish finally wear see truly recycled slop barely innovation thats im seeing well dont reason buy point want franchise end hell ubisoft whole since theyre either unwilling incapable innovate recycle different skin comment

wa good wouldnt oddysey wa killed series switched changed everything loved want witcher lite exactly leaf puzzle transition playerbase ha happened former playerbase evolve appreciate new arcade gen wa mostly replaced new player hate watchinghate fandom basically popular fanliking something seems reminds old adage love something never join fandom ive played feeling sheer wrongness get first simulation past unnatural wa awesome mixture scifi history something dont think ha done say valhalla killed mirage wa first title series didnt interest playing anymore sitting boat im interested sure somewhere line buck le included pas ill give shot thing valhalla taught dont tolerance ubisoft bloat deleted isnt situation aco still franchise trending valhalla pushed new high mirage trending currently wait see tends sell well real question see valhalla beyond success ubisoft definitely banking dud like mirage idk surprised havent spun franchise silly call anymore tale isu would appropriate could still like really build character exactly assassination damage youd fall short hit sneak kill always built character assassination though got stupidly strong assassination build odyssey liked bringing open world rpg aspect also liked classic formula definitely seems like plenty space series exist parallel pc ha got getting rotr exclusive aint exclusive anymore would say tower thing definitely patched way character said theyre listening feedback wa big honestly fine would playing primarily naoe prefer stealth ever go back replay handle mission differently spider man doe thing implied right deleted mirage wa made ubisoft bordeaux last quebec made wa odyssey na im talking team behind mirage wa wa made bordeaux team wa made quebec team thats im talking know already fwiw

trailer youtube tell story desperation current comment section votedownvote ratio seem well pretty negative whole english japanese response wont care controversy though itll come whether fun enough still given production delay im expecting cyberpunklevel flop appears back yasuke naoe wa yasuke big lumbering guy full samurai armour id like sure make sense shinobi set japan cant oneshot guy rice hat whoever designer decided doesnt get mean sure fact setting rather default clearly mean theyre focussing gameplay franchise like dishonored sniper elite hitman thats core gameplay everything core gameplay sad isnt genre anymore know previous quit back could tell thing going wrong direction another dude wa complaining another thread post want easy want assassination function assassination want assassination core gameplay rather button press start combat mean thats true though assassination bit literally admit enemy healthbar change colour based assassination attempt affect white mean guaranteed kill yellow mean youll damage wont actually kill red mean assassination denied three option work pretty standard stuff close worked previous title quit playing also write specific stealth assassination build theyve made yasuke based archery assassination clearly isnt unique ninja character either though might go slightly different way two character personally think going bring much needed variety gameplay k im going bother japanese character god fuck still issue ok cool doe positive patch content drop buy complete edition half price good time ubisoft know properly monetize without making pw recently greediness ruining would great odyssey valhalla pretty good mirage wa pw almost laughable im hoping decent feel somehow ubisoft gon na fuck im still previous console generation p specifically cant doe interesting feature stealth wise light visibility system like splinter cell including breaking light source cover gear causing different assassination move cause

experience default fix though think entire change stealthassassin flick switch nah going stay thats geared towards combat still kind different design philosophy youll notice geared towards regular combat instead stealth also mention availability setting ignore healthbar stuff make assassination guaranteed kill right dev hate answer mean intended default experience designed involves assassination working combat mandatory part dont trust designer think good direction take series played assassinoriented like dishonored hitman know whats theyre better honestly theyve progressed

idk absolutely enraged black character starring doesnt seem sentient also said kcd would flop gone woke adding gay romance black character yet selling like bonkers sorry nah much gamer full gamers arent going spend time like anecdotal surprised every non gamer know sport also stupidly popular wa nd marvel movie youre probably confusing tv show fair mcus movie postendgame kind shitty like successful coming huge mcu fan also stopped watching mcu cuz got burned negative circlejerk towards brie larson definitely didnt help either isnt kind funny mentioned captain marvel movie like doctor

wasnt trailer saw skillup preview playing hour rpg trilogy sold like hot cake broad appeal despise much dont even know mean rpg trilogy ha never rpg neither western eastern definition genre past year building following actionrpg subgenre reason throw away theyve also burning old fanbase time yasuke guy rather hack slash instead crawling dive doe anyone want offering though love hack slash yasukes combat seems extremely mundane doesnt speed real action hack n slash doesnt difficulty soulslike doesnt spectacle like warhammer god war middling every aspect closest get unique barging headfirst wall honestly look stupid absolutely reason two coexist best world best world two separate character required several story interval two different world youre switching case dont know issue wonder everyone hate forced stealth section videogames arent stealth dont like yasuke andor samurai playstyle ignorr better yet dont buy faith lose nothing playing yasuke negative talking need progress already confirmed besides doe guy think balanced around oneshot kill default setting turning cheat doesnt magically make design better youre using edge case attributing entire justify hatred even released truth dont know many enemy resist partially resist assassination baseline id assume regular enemy comparable level assassinated normally special enemy higher level enemy may require something whether thats combat sort special ability make assassination damage thats fine seems indicative good design oneshot every enemy would get boring repetitive within couple hour gameplay clearly disagree fundamental aspect make video fun im going dictate shouldnt obviously think fair dont preemptively judge clearly ignorant half fact said making better referring element challenge im oneshotting every enemy without even trying im challenged mean im fun would better challenge like example able oneshot enemy realistically intended extra challenge bos intended challenge youre intended able oneshot every single bosschallenge enemy ever encounter probably true however lucky devs letting bypass intended way dont want challenged point odyssey mean say yeah see youre coming extent agree tried relate experience playing odyssey certain level bracket odyssey regular assassination wa typically bit short killing regular weak soldier enemy yes bit ridiculous regular enemy appropriate level fight oneshot assassination attempt assassination way ive seen describe far however doesnt seem case enemy whatever reason level bos status etc stronger average seem oneshot personally although dont seem agree think make better worse oh also progress progressionchange necessarily improvement apology im misusing word im nonnative english speaker trying best however want incentivized gradually swap whatever gear im given level regardless whether rpg element good dev oh youre amateur dev think better everybody else industry whilst never put single idk panty bunch reasonable position lol gaming sub sub havent played since odyssey ancestral homeland excited im little bummed either girl black man japanese samurai lol actual samurai bloodline armor art decorates wall home would cool see someone looked like great great great great grandfather story time period profession opinion pretty easy understand feel like absolutely lol weird thing say youre missing point look ops post history literally nothing hype paid account purpose driving engagement didnt say anything wanting talked positively completely artificial discussion posted bot pointless crazy viciously defending post blatantly botted ubi well known thing youre kinda proving point want like see positive light stop defending bot account thats pay win jesus christ dont want company end conventional sense want end argument come position frustration disappointment kind development directly contributing company adapting making slop barely innovation injecting dlc burst encourages kind product sold played shift towards single player minimum effort ton dlc also designed keep playing paying thing want gone wishful thinking know ubisoft ea others major publisher push kind gamemaking dont want devs lose job want company forced change course let others asked answered going rant regarding psychology quite unhinged talking fucking video jesus christ man studio actually different location germany literally called ubisoft blue byte owned ubisoft yes real ubisoft title yeah wa sarcastic dude xd sure got downvoted guess comment wa taken defending bot seems like dont watch youtube think thats exclusive ubisoft dont reading text incorporates feeling emotion inherently incorrect written text doesnt carry nuance rhythm cadence intonation make vocal speech inherently need read emotionally neutral manner unless intent message emotional state writer character clarified obvious use word like transgression accurate word use relates intent message worst excess come form abusive dealbreaking issue like incorporating drm like denuvo year old like odyssey never removing refusing remove altaccount altlauncher requirement pc making nft cash shop single player item heavily effect gameplay thats without getting political rabbithole everything wrong word transgression isnt kind energy kind vague interpretative emotive reading isnt welcoming accurate word like neither inherently good bad used instance correctly proclaim brobdingnagian disdain hold ubisoft scrolled comment deleted exactly base design clearly focus around regular combat rather stealth takedown setting response complaint solution underlying issue guess forgotten real stealth arent particularly easier different kind difficulty involving stealth aspect much ill always compare stealth dishonored probably best example think particularly easy clear entire clean hand directly killing single person causing accident go murderhobo way stealth always encouraged generally dont resource swiftly deal whole gang itll highchaos ending youre using edge case attributing entire justify hatred even released fact youre calling edge case pretty grossly dismissive want assassination primary thing also hatred grossly overselling wanting hatred case apathy dont buy feel apathy towards truth dont know many enemy resist partially resist assassination dont care none baseline id assume regular enemy comparable level assassinated normally went ahead highlighted issue sentence thats fine know still harping seems indicative good design oneshot every enemy would get boring repetitive within couple hour gameplay let ask anyone complaining repetitive gameplay dishonored hitman sniper elite go figure wonder system number lmao really good design theyve gone generic levelling system wanted generic progression system sell loot think latter would qualify good design clearly disagree fundamental aspect make video fun im going dictate shouldnt obviously probably stopped right comment wa genuine thing truly stood think fair dont preemptively judge clearly ignorant half fact im ignorant fact im judging based marketing decide whether ill thats literally point marketing answer ive arrived said making better referring element challenge im oneshotting every enemy without even trying im challenged mean im fun truly dont explain im dev literally trained even teacher shut student insistence number difficulty especially stealth difficulty isnt many time hit enemy die manage get isolated kill elden ring example aneurysminducingly bad build vigour doublesoreseal level something mostly wanted hit stat requirement able use cool gear made end ng mess build truly understand wanting combat difficulty dont buy elden ringstyle whack dy combat used buy stealth gameplay parkour across rooftop im seeing devs letting bypass intended way dont want challenged lost youre arrogantly talking past im done entertaining shill nonsense person pretty negative argumentative dont waste time theyre yapping stubbornly ignoring fact exactly want already option negative frankly extremely rude want bypass element challenge difficulty levelscaling allowed anger seems stem fact isnt default option case dont agree le challenge fun also seem ignore fact theyve mentioned example also dont work way theyre describing dishonored example ha granted bos fight assassination isnt possible hitman frankly different genre altogether im dev know hard ha work make something im proud know want far go dozen better go right actually focus assassination rather whatever ha become literally go something like got lmao dictionary definition pay win practice paying get weapon ability etc give advantage player spend money seems like paying easier playthrough fit description asked exactly videogame shitting dont like especially havent liked year move everything
