categories only) Sounds about right || personally i would pop Ben Star in best performance for clive in ffxvi that man absolutely killed it, and maybe swap out mario wonder for ffxvi in goty (if you couldn't tell, ffxvi was my goty) || Every winner here is spot on. Except I don\\u2019t think journalists appreciated Hi-Fi as much as you and I did. || What a year guys, what a year.. || Laura Bailey would likely be nominated for supporting role for MJ, not full performance. Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see!\\n\\nI also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them?\\n\\nalso does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers.\\n\\nThere are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY.\\n\\nStarfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot.\\n\\nFor best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War.\\n\\nI also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that\\n\\nAlso did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show.\\n\\nAnd yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation.\\n\\nMy vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it.\\n\\nI think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues.\\n\\nI'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract.\\n\\nOh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. \\n\\nMajor issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. \\n\\nYou'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. \\n\\nCompanions seriously need way more dialog. \\n\\nAnd the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough?\\n\\nSaying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot?\\n\\nI agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing.\\n\\nYour ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope.\\n\\nPeople say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. \\n\\nCome on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. \\n\\nYou don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly.\\n\\nWhat you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. \\n\\nThat said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said.\\n\\nLet me make this very clear for you.\\n\\nYou MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own.\\n\\nYou just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying.\\n\\nI pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me.\\n\\nSo the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to.\\n\\nEdit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part.\\n\\nYou also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies?\\n\\nEdit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol.\\n\\nYou've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog.\\n\\nYou also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either.\\n\\nThen you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money.\\n\\nThis isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues.\\n\\nIn short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said.\\n\\nThere is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of.\\n\\nIt also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it.\\n\\nEdit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?**\\n\\nI have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing.\\n\\nI have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld.\\n\\nI'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them.\\n\\nI created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations:\\n\\nArmored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series\\n\\nI must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews.\\n\\nI want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. \\n\\nSo I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. \\n\\nPreferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have.\\n\\nHere my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game.\\n\\nBut DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?\\n\\nYou don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now*\\n\\nYou just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome!\\n\\nI usually choose the games that I play depending on how I feel about the story presented in the trailer, if it makes me curious enough to want to know more about the game world and explore it. || Stay off news sites to avoid fomo. Play what you feel like playing || Elden ring was one of my favorite games in the last 5 years. It was so fun I played it through multiple times. It was my first souls like, then I went to Sekiro, which was also sensational. || Simple solution is to get more picky. There are not even hundreds of good games in my back, makes it easier to play just the ones I want || I usually have one game I play with friends (at present Diablo 4)\\n\\nThen another game I play through solo ( at present final fantasy xvi) \\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m not into side content in single player games Because  it just becomes a slog, I finish the story and move on to the next one. || In the time you written that story you could have just picked a game and played it. || simple - i play the money game.  \\ngaming is just a hobby - there are rarely any games that rise up to the metric of value in terms of time invested.     \\nin the last 5 years i've played cumulatively like around 2 months of in game time. so few games are worth spending time in, they're mostly just repetitive time sinks.  \\nlike this year for eg i've played only bg3 to completion. i drop so many games after just a couple of hours(good thing youtube exists coz i can just see how the game ended if the story was what was interesting).   \\n\\n>Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), **BG3**, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, **dishonored series**, divinity original sin 1,2,**Doom eternal**, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, **Kingdom Come Dliverance**, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, **Prey**, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, **sekiro**, subnautica, **SIFU**, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, **titanfall 2**, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series   \\n\\ni bolded the games in your \\\"must play\\\" list that are actually worth playing, the rest are supremely skippable time sinks or have insanely long gameplay loops or just time gate you by making you \\\"collect resources\\\".  \\nsome games are just good for story - i just watched the guardians of the galaxy game on youtube at 1.5x speed on second monitor while working and i don't think i missed anything by not playing it myself. same with horizon zero series and latest spoodermans. || Im doing a 10 year system so basically right now im playing 2013 and 202e summer stuff, in fall its gonna be fall 2023 and 2013 fall stuff etc some stuff takes a bit longer || Thats me right now. Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. \\n\\nSometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games.\\n\\nAs other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music.\\n\\nI have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something.\\n\\nAlso, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list.\\n\\nAnd highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say:\\n\\nIf you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games\\n\\nAnd:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D\\n\\nYou wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. \\n\\n3 was ehh for me personally. \\n\\nSo i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. \\n\\nAlso try going random if you like all the game types. Assassains creed will take over 1k hours to even beat them double or triple to 100% them. \\n\\nSo i geuss careful with what you sink your teeth into || Just play what you are in the mood for. Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly.\\n\\nEdit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. \\n\\nFor me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed.  Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice.  It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time.  I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed. Get hooked on one at a time. Focus. || Did you reach the owl boss? I got stuck there.\",\n          \"1 week until MGS - Should I play Shadow of Mordor, Wolfenstein, Dragon Age: Inquisition or Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity? Got a week until MGS comes out so would like to try and beat something before it takes over the next month of my life\\n\\nAll on PC\\n\\n* Shadow of Mordor (Played on PS4, really liked it, only got a few hours in before other games took over)\\n\\n* Wolfenstein (Played a tiny bit and it looked good, probably the shortest game)\\n\\n* Dragon Age: Inquisition (Loved DA:O and enjoyed DA2, might be a bit too long to enjoy in just one week)\\n\\n* Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity (Both look interesting, I've only ever played Asscreed 2 and it took me months to complete because it was really dull to me, but heard great things about the later games) Out of all of those, I enjoyed the story of Black Flag the most. But I would not recommend you play it if you're looking to complete it in a week. I would recommend a slow play of the game to take in the role of being a pirate to it's fullest.\\n\\nWolfenstein has a great story that's not too long but not too short. Complete this game and move on to Black Flag in the future when you have time. || Shadow of Mordor or Wolfenstein. Both are brilliant and you don't really have time to play the others if you only have a week.  || Black Flag is a really good game. But I absolutely recommend Shadow of Mordor over any of these.\\n\\nYou don't need to play DA:I. Not until you're entirely out of games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Except I don\\u2019t think journalists appreciated Hi-Fi as much as you and I did. || What a year guys, what a year.. || Laura Bailey would likely be nominated for supporting role for MJ, not full performance. Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see!\\n\\nI also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them?\\n\\nalso does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers.\\n\\nThere are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY.\\n\\nStarfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot.\\n\\nFor best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War.\\n\\nI also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that\\n\\nAlso did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show.\\n\\nAnd yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation.\\n\\nMy vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it.\\n\\nI think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues.\\n\\nI'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract.\\n\\nOh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. \\n\\nMajor issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. \\n\\nYou'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. \\n\\nCompanions seriously need way more dialog. \\n\\nAnd the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough?\\n\\nSaying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot?\\n\\nI agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing.\\n\\nYour ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope.\\n\\nPeople say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. \\n\\nCome on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. \\n\\nYou don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly.\\n\\nWhat you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. \\n\\nThat said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said.\\n\\nLet me make this very clear for you.\\n\\nYou MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own.\\n\\nYou just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying.\\n\\nI pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me.\\n\\nSo the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to.\\n\\nEdit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part.\\n\\nYou also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies?\\n\\nEdit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol.\\n\\nYou've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog.\\n\\nYou also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either.\\n\\nThen you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money.\\n\\nThis isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues.\\n\\nIn short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said.\\n\\nThere is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of.\\n\\nIt also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it.\\n\\nEdit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?**\\n\\nI have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing.\\n\\nI have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld.\\n\\nI'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them.\\n\\nI created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations:\\n\\nArmored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series\\n\\nI must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews.\\n\\nI want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. \\n\\nSo I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. \\n\\nPreferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have.\\n\\nHere my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game.\\n\\nBut DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?\\n\\nYou don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now*\\n\\nYou just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome!\\n\\nI usually choose the games that I play depending on how I feel about the story presented in the trailer, if it makes me curious enough to want to know more about the game world and explore it. || Stay off news sites to avoid fomo.

It was my first souls like, then I went to Sekiro, which was also sensational. || Simple solution is to get more picky.

Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. \\n\\nSometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games.\\n\\nAs other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music.\\n\\nI have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something.\\n\\nAlso, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list.\\n\\nAnd highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say:\\n\\nIf you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games\\n\\nAnd:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D\\n\\nYou wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. \\n\\n3 was ehh for me personally. \\n\\nSo i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. \\n\\nAlso try going random if you like all the game types. Assassains creed will take over 1k hours to even beat them double or triple to 100% them. \\n\\nSo i geuss careful with what you sink your teeth into || Just play what you are in the mood for. Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly.\\n\\nEdit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. \\n\\nFor me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed.  Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice.  It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time.  I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed. Get hooked on one at a time. Focus. || Did you reach the owl boss?

Got a week until MGS comes out so would like to try and beat something before it takes over the next month of my life\\n\\nAll on PC\\n\\n* Shadow of Mordor (Played on PS4, really liked it, only got a few hours in before other games took over)\\n\\n* Wolfenstein (Played a tiny bit and it looked good, probably the shortest game)\\n\\n* Dragon Age: Inquisition (Loved DA:O and enjoyed DA2, might be a bit too long to enjoy in just one week)\\n\\n* Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity (Both look interesting, I've only ever played Asscreed 2 and it took me months to complete because it was really dull to me, but heard great things about the later games) Out of all of those, I enjoyed the story of Black Flag the most.

Except I don\\u2019t think journalists appreciated Hi-Fi as much as you and I did. || What a year guys, what a year.. || Laura Bailey would likely be nominated for supporting role for MJ, not full performance. Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see! I also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them? also does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers. There are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY. Starfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot. For best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War. I also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that Also did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show. And yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation. My vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it. I think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate \\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues. I'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently. It'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract. Oh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. Major issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. You'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. Companions seriously need way more dialog. And the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough? Saying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot? I agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing. Your ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope. People say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. &#x200B; You're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. Come on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. You don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly. What you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. That said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said. Let me make this very clear for you. You MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own. You just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying. I pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me. So the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to. Edit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part. You also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. I don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies? Edit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol. You've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog. You also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either. Then you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money. This isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues. In short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said. There is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of. It also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it. Edit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?** I have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing. I have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld. I'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them. I created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations: Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series I must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews. I want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list! &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. So I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. Preferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here. Here's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have. Here my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game. But DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play? You don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now* You just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome! I usually choose the games that I play depending on how I feel about the story presented in the trailer, if it makes me curious enough to want to know more about the game world and explore it. || Stay off news sites to avoid fomo. Play what you feel like playing || Elden ring was one of my favorite games in the last 5 years. It was so fun I played it through multiple times. It was my first souls like, then I went to Sekiro, which was also sensational. || Simple solution is to get more picky. There are not even hundreds of good games in my back, makes it easier to play just the ones I want || I usually have one game I play with friends (at present Diablo 4) Then another game I play through solo ( at present final fantasy xvi) I\\u2019m not into side content in single player games Because it just becomes a slog, I finish the story and move on to the next one. || In the time you written that story you could have just picked a game and played it. || simple - i play the money game. gaming is just a hobby - there are rarely any games that rise up to the metric of value in terms of time invested. in the last 5 years i've played cumulatively like around 2 months of in game time. so few games are worth spending time in, they're mostly just repetitive time sinks. like this year for eg i've played only bg3 to completion. i drop so many games after just a couple of hours(good thing youtube exists coz i can just see how the game ended if the story was what was interesting). >Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), **BG3**, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, **dishonored series**, divinity original sin 1,2,**Doom eternal**, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, **Kingdom Come Dliverance**, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, **Prey**, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, **sekiro**, subnautica, **SIFU**, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, **titanfall 2**, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series i bolded the games in your \\\"must play\\\" list that are actually worth playing, the rest are supremely skippable time sinks or have insanely long gameplay loops or just time gate you by making you \\\"collect resources\\\". some games are just good for story - i just watched the guardians of the galaxy game on youtube at 1.5x speed on second monitor while working and i don't think i missed anything by not playing it myself. same with horizon zero series and latest spoodermans. || Im doing a 10 year system so basically right now im playing 2013 and 202e summer stuff, in fall its gonna be fall 2023 and 2013 fall stuff etc some stuff takes a bit longer || Thats me right now. Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. Sometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games. As other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music. I have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something. Also, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list. And highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say: If you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games And:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D You wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. 3 was ehh for me personally. So i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. Also try going random if you like all the game types. Assassains creed will take over 1k hours to even beat them double or triple to 100% them. So i geuss careful with what you sink your teeth into || Just play what you are in the mood for. Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly. Edit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. For me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed. Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice. It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time. I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed. Get hooked on one at a time. Focus. || Did you reach the owl boss? I got stuck there.\",\n          \"1 week until MGS - Should I play Shadow of Mordor, Wolfenstein, Dragon Age: Inquisition or Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity? Got a week until MGS comes out so would like to try and beat something before it takes over the next month of my life All on PC * Shadow of Mordor (Played on PS4, really liked it, only got a few hours in before other games took over) * Wolfenstein (Played a tiny bit and it looked good, probably the shortest game) * Dragon Age: Inquisition (Loved DA:O and enjoyed DA2, might be a bit too long to enjoy in just one week) * Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity (Both look interesting, I've only ever played Asscreed 2 and it took me months to complete because it was really dull to me, but heard great things about the later games) Out of all of those, I enjoyed the story of Black Flag the most. But I would not recommend you play it if you're looking to complete it in a week. I would recommend a slow play of the game to take in the role of being a pirate to it's fullest. Wolfenstein has a great story that's not too long but not too short. Complete this game and move on to Black Flag in the future when you have time. || Shadow of Mordor or Wolfenstein. Both are brilliant and you don't really have time to play the others if you only have a week. || Black Flag is a really good game. But I absolutely recommend Shadow of Mordor over any of these. You don't need to play DA:I. Not until you're entirely out of games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ready_text\",\n      \"properties\":
