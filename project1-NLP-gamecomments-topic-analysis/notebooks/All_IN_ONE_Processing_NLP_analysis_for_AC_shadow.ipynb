Plus, the games are available on Xbox Series X. Hope this helps! || So you want a ham-fisted, cartoony game with mustache-twirling villains, and you *don\\u2019t* want linear gameplay?\\n\\nIf there was a Venn diagram of your tastes, the circles wouldn\\u2019t even overlap. I wonder if you\\u2019re *deliberately* being difficult. \\n\\nIf not, maybe you should be asking a therapist for game recommendations, not us, because you seem to be having some difficulty compromising with\\u2026 well, the entire art of game design. || You are impossible.  \\n\\nBut the closest games I changed think of are the old BioWare ones that had (light side / dark side) player choices for just about everything, with not much ambiguity.  KOTOR, KOTOR2, Mass Effect.  \\n\\nDragon Age was also similar but more ambiguous, as you had to choose between siding with Apostates or Templars, which each have their own flaws. || Well most games depict humans or creatures that are very close to humans and human beings are morally grey. No-one is perfect or always does good 24/7 even if they are not aware of it and if someone spends a lot of time trying to convince they are 100% good  I would strongly advise you to get as far away from that person as possible \\ud83e\\udd23 || I won\\u2019t say they\\u2019re well written, but you could try Fable.

You kind of listed most genres as what you aren\\u2019t interested in, and \\u201cwell written\\u201d is subjective and rarely a sentiment that even 5 people can all agree on. || Well, I wish you the best of luck in your search because there\\u2019s not really much out there that\\u2019s going to completely satisfy you as those are *really* stringent criteria.\\n\\nBest game I can think of which comes close to that is Stardew Valley. || What are some games you like? || Red Dead Redemption II || I mean what does morally ambiguous mean to you if something like Assassin's Creed is?\\n\\nAbstergo Industries is evil and there's not much gray in between. || Lol, some nice racing game I guess if you don\\u2019t like ANY of those and don\\u2019t have a ps4/pa5 cause otherwise I\\u2019d say horizon zero dawn or Spider-Man.

Mad Max? But might be a bit too car oriented? || Have you considered Dead Space. Also your \\\"preferences\\\" are strict and stupid it removes most games. Also kid games are fun, have you played a Lego game while high or with someone who is, because it makes it way more fun || Touch grace op || Lol bro go touch grass. But the Fable series is great. Better than all the trash games you listed in OP || First, It\\u2019s called preference. It irked me that you people don\\u2019t realize that. Second, I only want well written good vs evil stories not cartoony cliche ones. Thirdly, I don\\u2019t like morally gray because I feel like they\\u2019re trying to make you sympathize or be relatable to horrible people like terrorists, serial killers etc. It doesn\\u2019t click with me and it\\u2019s disgusting. Which is why I extremely hate morally gray. Fourthly, linear games don\\u2019t have replayability and doesn\\u2019t allow you to play your own way. Finally, I\\u2019m not being difficult. You can\\u2019t force someone to like a type of storytelling or type of game they don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not saying you have to agree with me.

Otherwise you\\u2019re going to come off as toxic, unhelpful, or rude. || Kotor 1 is fairly stock good vs evil, but Kotor 2 lives in shades of ambiguity || [removed] || Thanks. || It\\u2019s called preference. Also Stardew Valley doesn\\u2019t have a story, it\\u2019s a simulator, and a kids game. || I don\\u2019t have any games that I like currently. Reason being so because all the games I listed as morally gray is what I mostly played. || If he thinks Gerald of Rivia is \\u201cmoral ambiguous\\u201d then can\\u2019t imagine what he\\u2019ll think of Arthur. Which is tragic cause he\\u2019s missing out. || Assassin\\u2019s Creed has always been morally gray. Assassins and Templars only have ideas what\\u2019s best for humanity. Assassins want free will and Templars want Peace and Order. The only morally evil things in Assassin\\u2019s Creed is most Isu and the Instrument of the First Will. || You do realize I listed racing games as a type of game I\\u2019m not interested in. || I like games. I just don\\u2019t like games with a morally gray story and characters, linear games, and games with no story. I also prefer M-rated. I haven\\u2019t put Open World, Non-Linear, Immersive Sims, and Horror games on the list. || If you\\u2019re going to help me. If you\\u2019re going to be toxic with me for no apparent reason then leave. I\\u2019m not going to accept crap from people like you. || The morally gray that means lack of what\\u2019s right and what\\u2019s wrong. Unclear if someone is good and evil. Neither good or evil. Also that tries to make you be relatable or sympathize with evil people. Which I don\\u2019t like. I prefer playing as a morally good protagonist. || Hatred also not ambiguous Just evil || Alright thanks. || I haven\\u2019t tried Doom, so I can\\u2019t give you my thoughts. || Wow. You must be really uncomfortable with how life works... || Oh bless your little cotton socks! || Oooof, wrong on every count there my friend. It does have a story, but it\\u2019s an emergent one and it\\u2019s not just a farming game.\\n\\nAnd yes, I\\u2019m aware it\\u2019s called a preference. Stop being so defensive bud, that\\u2019s why other users are losing their temper with you. || What about Doom and the person who said the Arkham games. || Morally* || Geralt is morally ambigious lol. His whole spiel is about neutrality and tiptoeing the neutrality line || Ah shit I was trying to give sarcastic answers but now that I\\u2019m rereading the post they actually listed RDR2 || Templar want power and will do anything to attain that power and control people. \\n\\nThat,  to me,  is the root of all evil.  Power seeking and a lack of empathy.  Personal liberty and freedom is the only choice. || Well that seams to be the only thing suited lol that or strategy, but if you play that the wrong way that could moral ambiguous or gray too haha || Okay, but most if not all horror games are linear, meaning that would cancel out the whole genre. Open world games tend to be your version of morally ambiguous since you can choose your path to be good or evil. Are there certain games that put you off the entire genre? For example say you played  ride to hell: retribution and now you hate linear games. You mentioned you have no games you like right now. Are there games you liked previously? If so what are they? It may be easier to suggest with more info || I've come to the conclusion, after reading your responses in this post, that you yourself are fairly morally ambiguous which is probably where the problem  originates. || Oh to be an innocent child again life would be so simple \\ud83e\\udd23 || I\\u2019m not being defensive, I\\u2019m stating facts. || Assassin\\u2019s Creed Comuunity and other fans will say other wise. ||  Don\\u2019t play games with no story and I\\u2019m not a fan of turn based combat, || I don\\u2019t like linear games because they lack replayability and don\\u2019t allow you to go about a situation in your own way (not talking about choices). I have a problem with Elder Scrolls and Fallout because if you want to do a morally good or morally evil character. Either certain quests or the main story forces you to be morally gray which I dislike. Fallout: New Vegas is a good example of this. Assassin\\u2019s Creed I used to like but started realize it\\u2019s morally gray. || [removed] || All three things you stated by default, are opinions. Just because you believe them doesn\\u2019t make them facts. \\n\\nIf you want a more serious game that fits your criteria, you\\u2019re shit outta luck because I would suggest Horizon Zero Dawn but that\\u2019s not available on your console of choice. || Yea this is reddit, were all going to hell || And Forbidden West ruins Horizon with morally gray and the story being predictable unlike Zero Dawn.

They were just clean 5 spoke wheels. || Its a really good game but If you only want to play the single player Its not worth it in my opinion also make sure to play with a controller || Yes Multiplayer is great but the learning curve is high \\n(Campaign does explain it very good tho) || [deleted] || on a side note, halo 1-3, odst, and reach are all great || I don\\u2019t want to oversell it to you but there\\u2019s a reason why whenever someone talk about \\u201cstory\\u201d in videogames I remember this game! || Is it quite a skilful game to play? Looks like you need to dodge a lot... I\\u2019m not known for my subtle plays \\ud83d\\ude02 || That the space pirate follower? || It has 4 difficulties and builds, I am sure you can find what suits you || You don't have to be subtle, only in a few story base missions like maybe 5 all together\",\n          \">At the beginning of the game, your world map will only contain region names. As you travel around, a radius of the map around the player will gradually be revealed. Viewpoints have been re-introduced, but they'll reveal less than in past entries of the series. These will be listed as undiscovered locations if the player hasn't visited the area prior.\\n\\nThis seems to be exactly the system that already exists, no? || We got to whip the map and GPS out like Far Cry 2? || I only play games with yellow paint to tell me where to climb || Ubisoft, the issue isn't the fucking icons themselves - it's the copy paste repetitive tasks that accompany those icons. || If it's like Odyssey, but with more costum made quests, less useless clutter and an reworked combat/stealth moveset...\\n\\nI would be very happy. || I'll wait until it is out for some time and have read reviews of reviewers I trust. Been burned too many times to just blow money out of the window.\\n\\nThis news, at least, reads like a \\\"yeah, sounds like a good idea\\\"-thing. || I have no issue with map markers and *you can turn them off* ffs || You could always turn off specific marker types in the menu? I don\\u2019t know why marker bloat is an issue in an AC game; you customize the map how you\\u2019d like. || For open world rpg style please just go back to how AC Odyssey was || Go full elden ring and not even show where the next quest objective is || As long as I can toggle specific icon types on and off. Mirage had that. || Really hope it doesn\\u2019t try to be like Elden ring tho. I don\\u2019t want to be lost and unsure what to do 90% of the time to pad out game time || Honestly I don\\u2019t mind if there wasn\\u2019t too much difference of activities. Taking down hideouts/outposts/forts, parkour puzzle, searching for treasure, etc is fine. I always just felt like there was way too much and makes each time less and less fun. I do like taking down a fort but taking down 20 is not fun. Less is more is fine. \\n\\nI do think they don\\u2019t need towers. Star Wars Outlaws doesn\\u2019t have any kind of tower system and you just drive around and find points of interest. Or you can buy \\u201cintel\\u201d from shops and they\\u2019ll point one thing out for you. It\\u2019s nice and lets you find stuff organically still or get small hints for things. \\n\\nStar Wars Outlaws should be the evolution of the AC map system. || it had also better cut down on forcing you to grind levels doing fetch quests to advance the main story. origins and the next two are straight trash compared to the og games. also sword sponging, never again you clowns || Icons are not the root problem, but a symptom. The issue is that the map is filled with repeated activities and pointless collectables in every direction. || FINALLY! That's what people have been waiting for! Not a game that works and is fun, without shitty microtransactions shoved down your throat at every turn, but a game with less map icons! Ubisoft is saved! || They've spent all this time removing extraneous icons? No wonder it took so long. || This game is still gonna suck ass || I still don't understand why they need to put any icons anywhere? Why can the player not just run into an npc? Why can't a player just run into a treasure chest while exploring? Devs need to stop being so afraid that players will miss some of the content they've made. Just have a little faith damn. \\n\\nIt just feels so much better to come across things on a map naturally. Not by running to a way point. || They are cutting down on profits as well. || And stupid playable characters that don\\u2019t make any sense? || The fact Ubi cannot let this game speak for itself should tell you everything you need to know about the quality therein. Feels like every other day some PR blurb comes out explaining basic gameplay systems in a reassuring light. || As if that\\u2019ll save the game || After the ezio games they fell off hard || But they won,t change my gender: still and forever non-buynary! || Do they still do the animus and future sequences? || I\\u2019m struggling to remember but thought the game, maybe odyssey or Valhalla, gave you an option to have less of these map markers or more?  What\\u2019s new here || I\\u2019ve payed a lot of these games and now I feel this map hiding scheme is annoying and makes me want to explore less. Just stop.  Open it up as the story progresses. || Did they confirmed a system akin to Avatar ? Would play it if it's in but probably skipping if there is nothing of the sort. || My issue with Valhalla was that they made finding and doing all the side activities and collectibles obtuse. I loved AC for chasing icons on the map and having fun climbing and combat. I dont want a hardcore exploration sim where missing a single line of dialogue means i can never complete my objective or where i have to search the side of a mountain for an hour looking for a cave entrance so i can get some loot. Just bring back guided mode like they had in AC:Odyssey and GR:Breakpoint so i can play with a damn podcast on and not waste all my time looking for a tiny ass key because they refuse to give me any information.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re at it, lets get rid of the dialogue options and focus on writing 1 good, compelling story, rather than 10 ok-ish stories filled with stilted voice acting. And please don\\u2019t bring back the mountains of .01% better loot that you have to stop and sift through for 20 minutes every hour and a half of gameplay.\\n\\nOrigins was perfect, imo. Had the best blend of classic AC and RPG elements. The next 2 went way too far into the RPG bullshit that just bogged down the experience. || Please less text on screen, too. Don\\u2019t need three quest updates, collectible counter, \\u201chelpful\\u201d hints, mini map, button prompts, daily challenge, special messages\\u2026 || Just like Star Wars Outlaws? || Devs who work on open world games are always afraid that players might miss sth they've worked on for 100s of hours, so by putting questions markers and % trackers they make these objectives feel like an obligation rather than something players would organically go and explore.\\n\\nMore devs need to follow the Red dead redemption 2 or Elden ring example and have confidence in the world they built, have confidence that players will enjoy it so much they will willingly wander around so they can find obscure secrets hidden within the map. || I want some more quality linear story games and less huge open worlds that either feel empty or full of meh. || Is that to go with their profit as well? || Will we be able to play a samurai ? || Damn, I hoped it wasn\\u2019t Farcry 3 all over again. I already played that game, I don\\u2019t need another one. || I mean it really can't get worse than the AC Unity map. || It also cut down on players || Sound like they are going to cut the game eventually || But if they do that then there will be no game left. || Who cares || Meaning it will waste even more of your time. || Yay no more checklists || Will they cut down on present day sequences? || I really like the way SW Outlaws handled the map, hope it is similar || Oh boy, more getting lost simulators, thanks Souls fans for fucking over the rest of us. || I'm not buying that one only because i'm tired of the same old Ubisoft formula. I feel like if you played one of them, you played all of them. || Incredible, will it also cut down on the mediocreness ubishit tends to release? || its basically assassins creed 2 for 10+ years how are people still playing them || Big issies of theirs has always been them clearly showing whwre every piece of content is on the map making the space inbetween feel empty and exploration non existent. || What the need to do is copy GOT game design and remove the level gates || Dear Ubisoft,\\n\\nPick up a copy of Horizon Forbidden West. Head to the settings and check out the HUD area. Click \\\"Customize\\\".\\n\\nSee all those options? Take notes. || Thank God. The next one might actually have less things to collect than banjo-kazooie did || Don't they normally have HUD options that let you turn these elements off anyway? || I hope we at least get proper quests and a quest log instead of that horrible world events system Valhalla had || They\\u2019re doing everything they can to make it seem like they haven\\u2019t made the same exact game for the 50th time || Lmao\\u00a0 || Will it cut down on bloat as well? || Literally all I want is a game that isn\\u2019t 100 hours, and is functional with a decent story. All I ask || Finally! Less cluttered maps will make exploration feel more immersive, bringing back the true Assassin's Creed vibe. Excited. || I really hope this game does well for them, it seems like they're putting so much effort into it || Doing this change this late is a recipe for disasters. They have come over relient on those to guide the player and I have no faith in their Level Design to be able to guide the player nearly enough. || This has been the case since far cry 3 radio tower climbing shit and they used the same fucking thing and same fucking playstyle for 13 years just because it was succesful once doesnt mean it will be forever they gotta stop making boring mediocre games to please stakeholders and insted listen to the community. || I'm not touching this without seeing some seriously positive reviews from independent reviewers. || I for one can\\u2019t wait to try this game out as internet YouTube \\u201coutrage for clicks\\u201d grifters don\\u2019t dictate what I like. Hopefully it\\u2019s not as boring as Vahalla which I couldn\\u2019t even finish || Map splat is the symptom of crappy maps, not the core of the issue. They can tinker round the edges, more information, less information. It won\\u2019t help the core problem of there being nothing to discover and the map design being beyond simplistic. || Im interested to see if this game manages to be better that Ghost of Tsushima in any way || Here's hoping they fiiiinally learned their lesson. It's literally their last chance to save Ubisoft.   \\nI'm liking what I'm seeing with the new movement mechanics. Really hoping they nail this one. || Bro, just continue the  Desmond/Ezio  storyline and go back to the stealth combat/parkour roots.\\n\\n  \\nprofit and save the effin company.\\n\\n  \\nalso, Black Flag was the last \\\"acceptable\\\" AC || fucking Upi love to dumb random shit all across the map like mad babysitter go and have fun || Ubisoft created the way to save the company from becoming bankrupt...deleting map icons. a small hint for the game designers. if the game is shit - making it harder won't help || A swing and a miss || I wish they'd cut down the game completely. Honestly Ubishit really just needs to go || [deleted] || Yeah\\u2026the game is still gonna bomb. || Ubisoft desperately need a W here, feels like they've been on a losing streak for so long || they say this everytime and its never been true once || I never get this criticism. Unity went overboard. Since then, it's been fine. I saw people gushing about Ghost of Tsushima about its mapcand lack of icons, it has more than AC brotherhood had.\\n\\nWhat games need to do is bring back minimaps for things like that. Oh this *area* is the shopping area, the minimal will show the exact location of shops. \\n\\nGhost of Tsushima & horizon forbidden west had me opening my map every 5 minutes. || There are still coming sequels? || So basically they CBF making more content? || The biggest problem with open world games is that the world exists to waste your time. The devs aren't given time to fill ot with anything interesting. Witcher 3 taught is this, with its bar setting side quests.\\n\\nThis game will be no different. Just a world full of low effort filler. || I want an Assassin's Creed where Im a native American, sneaking around in the desert, who slowly tries to take out the settlers killing the people and stealing land. Maybe a pet wolf for a companion. You use the eagle to scout and see through its vision.\\u00a0 || They can try cutting down the price of the game too. || You've played Ghost of Tsushima. Now play Ghost of Tsushima, but shitty! || Ghost of Tsushima's use of the environment to steer you is so much more immersive than \\\"mindlessly follow the icons\\\", and I have zero faith that Ubisoft can learn from it. || I havent played past Valhalla, but map was only revealed via dive towers.  Sounds like you can just naturally explore the map now and have it be properly revealed wherever you go.  Hopefully that means *less* collecting all the Ubisoft Towers and more organic exploration/gameplay. || Ubisoft are the masters at making the same game every year and twisting words to make it sound different. || People haven't played any of the recent ubisoft games that they bitch about for some reason || The idea of the full article is that the game will be less hand-holdy than previous ones with more emphasis on discovering things yourself instead of having viewpoints reveal whole chunks of map at once. || Same as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. Question marks appearing (and saving) on the map only when you in some radius near them || I think they mean the viewpoints will work like they did in Shadow of War, wherein the POI\\u2019s become marked on the map by directing the camera in their direction. Instead of the typical synchronization points where many different POI\\u2019s were just automatically marked. || Not exactly. The question marks would normally be on the map before revealing, then would fill with what is at the location from using a viewpoint. This reveals that something is there, but you can\\u2019t tell what it is until you go there. Which honestly, sounds pretty good to me. A lot closer to what that scouting actually gives you in information rather than just knowing what a place is from a bird eye view a hundred miles away. || Just diffrent minigames probably xd || There were tons more viewpoints in the early games. I didn't mind that. Just don't make them all the same and tedious to climb like they were in Black Flag. || You would think || View points used to show you like every chest and activity in the area.\\n\\n\\\"Viewpoints have been re-introduced, but they'll reveal less than in past entries of the series\\\" \\n\\nIt's probably just gonna be vague about it now. || Sounds like it\\u2019s more akin to the way Breath of the Wild reveals the map now to me. I haven\\u2019t played an entry in the series since syndicate though so I don\\u2019t know how it works in the most recent games || Sounds like how Apple introduces supposedly new features that already exist in other phones. || kinda feels like the worksheet Witcher 3 system but with viewpoints || It\\u2019s the GoT system, the RPG AC games used viewpoints to reveal the map || Yes, but unity went a bit overboard, and AC3 was the start of it being a bit cluttered.\\n\\nBut like everyone that criticised assassin's creed it's something was fixed more than 10 years ago, but they couldn't be bothered to see if it was still like it or not.\\n\\nSeeFar Cry 6. Somehow its just another recycled heap of crapnwhere they never change anything, and at the same time the new superweapons and ammo type have changed the game too much and they should have stuck to their roots. || Exactly the same system, but *harder*. || Idk. It's kinda clear that this is just performative in the hopes people don't just go \\\"more ubisoft nonsense\\\" || [deleted] || I love how they just discovered fog of war and they're trying to pass it as an innovative feature. || I loved that mechanic honestly || First time i played through far cry 2 i ran out of meds right after falling out of the truck at the start of act 2 lmao. Good times || Or white paint ala Tomb Raider. || That I believe. || Thank you, this is what drives me crazy about this topic online. People act like if they just turn off all the map markers that'll make clearing 500 samey outposts more compelling. || Yeah, Elden Ring was so much better with its copy pasted smaller dungeons and reused bosses. Fighting the Erdtree Avatar for the fourth time feels so rewarding! || Isn't it the same in the witcher 3 ? Go to place, find monster, kill monster || ...Yeah the exploration mode or w/e the hell it was called in Valhalla didn't improve the game any. The locations were still boring and the activities the same. Finding an uninspired cache of crap 100 times is the problem not the map. In fact scouring for the uninspired stuff somehow feels even worse a lot of the time. || Exactly ! || I thought it was just a joke in my head, but this company might truly rather go bankrupt then change their decade old gameplay loop || We've been sitting on benches eavesdropping on conversations since 2007, more of that aint it. || Well sure but map markers are also a big problem in open world games. The map becomes all powerful and you end up spending the game staring at a little map in the corner. More stuff should be integrated into the game world. || Did you like odyssey more than origins? I thought origins was the best new one and every iteration after has been a regression. || they also hopefully got rid of the highlights around your character / enemies when you are in stealth mode or engaging them. it made everything feel so cartoony || [deleted] || this just means they\\u2019re putting less content in the game \\ud83d\\ude02 || Jokes aside the open world ac games do have a option to play with a more immersive map, meaning quest markers won't tell you exactly where your quest is, only the directions like \\\"west of X city, south of a lake\\\" and then you have to use the eagle to find the quest marker once you are close enough. is how i played the three of them. || Elden ring quest is easily the worst aspect of the game. || I see you've never played Morrowind.\\n\\n\\\"I need you to kill some bandits in a cave. They're somewhere south of Sadrith Mora. Go west from the boat dock until you see a rock shaped like a Kwama. Turn slightly south when the path turns north and climb over the ridge. If you've reached the water you've gone too far. Some ways past that you will find a shrine. Keep going until you find Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins, the cave should be near the third fallen tower.\\\" || You can actually do that already as an optional setting in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. || I enjoyed Elden Ring a lot but I despised the fact I had to look at walkthroughs to see how to continue an intriguing questline. If the rest of the game wasn\\u2019t so good I wouldn\\u2019t have bothered and just stopped playing. || I wouldn\\u2019t mind that if progressing the story didn\\u2019t lock you out of whole quest chains. || In Bloodborne any hints about the game basics you get only after you die and you have to fucking pick them up from the ground and read. || Because they made a giant empty map with a small handful of copy pasted events you\\u2019d never even bump into if they didn\\u2019t outright force it with absolutely no effort put into making things discoverable without them. But hey, now they made the icons require you to wander aimlessly more I\\u2019m sure that will be just as good as making an interesting map! || Yes, but theres alot less of it || Until you realise that you are still just revealing multiples of the same thing throughout the entire map.\\n\\nIt's the same formula, the same mechanic, just not revealed to the player in the same way.\\n\\nAs old and sometimes annoying as the cluttered map thing is, it doesn't really bother me when all is said and done.  If the game is fun to play and can keep me interested I'll enjoy it regardless.\\n\\nWith any luck players can also apply filters to display only what they want, or nothing at all.  I'd probably prefer to just filter the map to display nothing at all in an attempt to up the immersion to a maximum.  Maybe only display major settlements/ villages and castle towns etc.\\n\\nIt is promising to hear that they've taken a slightly different approach though I guess.  Just got to wait and see how that actually translates into the actual game with regards to exploration and the all too familiar viewpoints. || Wdym? This has been planned since the start. One of the goals of shadows was to improve the open world and make it more dynamic || Maybe the idea is that you'll keep finding *something*, not something specific. That's part of the appeal of open-world games. || I kind of liked the playful jab at this in Far Cry 5 where you watch the John seed video || I\\u2019m sure Ubisoft can buy plenty of those. || I'm expecting that in some. I think map is given, GoT is quite empty and shadows will have big cities and a lot of npcs. Maybe side quests, most AC games have better generic side quests than GoT which was just the same kill mongols/bandits repeated. Collectibles is a bit questionable, but at least it won't have 49 fox dens. Main story can be, I don't really like GoT's generic honorable samurai trope, but who knows. Where I don't think shadows will match GoT is combat for sure. || tsushima, not a chance, wokeshima, maybe || I hope they will but I doubt it. From what I\\u2019ve seen from gameplay snippets, it looks like they pasted Valhalla and Odyssey again with a handful of new animations. || Valhalla made over a billion the current way sells no matter how much reddit wants to keep saying its the same game || Ubisoft has had time saver packs that revealed locations as early as Black Flag (AC 4). || Am I the only one who finds these \\\"eagles as drones\\\" unbearably ridiculous? || That\\u2019s how it worked in AC III (and maybe the earlier ones?). Walking at ground level revealed a small area around you on the world map. Traveling on rooftops and higher elevations would reveal a wider radius around you, and the viewpoints revealed a very large radius around them.\\n\\nI remember in AC III, you had to uncover like 95% of the world map to fulfill the criteria to 100% the game, which required a good bit of exploration across parts of the frontier map that had no convenient viewpoints.\\n\\nI think around Unity they dropped that idea and districts were completely visible when you unlock or cross into them for the first time. || The way it's described makes me worry they're just going to have icons not show up until you get near, but that's only part of the issue with the ubisoft open world \\\"map checklist of boring side quests\\\" games. It still needs to feel like you're finding something in the world and not finding a glowing mini-game start promp that poops money at you for jumping on shit for no reason. || I'm not sure about how organic that alternative really is \\ud83d\\ude05 || They already made it so you could turn off the guided experience and play exactly as you described. They did the same in several other of their franchises as well. || This sounds similar to Ghost Recon Breakpoint's exploration system. Things appear on your minimap within a certain radius as an undiscovered location, and only show up on the map if either you gained some info revealing that location (by interrogating someone or something), or if you visit it yourself. I still think that game reveals too much info to the player, but it's a far cry better than it could be. || Might be closer to modern gaming, but it strips yet another part of the Assassin\\u2019s Creed identity. Assassin\\u2019s Towers were required because you would often be lost with the blurred minimap in the labyrinths that were the cities from the Ezio trilogy.  You lost this a bit with the more open-world III and Black Flag, but Unity brought it back and I always saw this as one of the integral parts of the AC experience. The view points are your first pitstop in any new area.\\n\\nYet, this is one of the many, many identities of the franchise that Ubisoft is stripping, so who the fuck cares? || I honestly wouldn't mind if the game play didn't change much if the stories were good. I recently replayed the Ezio trilogy and had a blast. Then I played AC3. They not only completely changed the gameplay, which I didn't like, but there was absolutely so story to speak of. || They did not write the article || I just wish they made another Rayman \\ud83d\\ude14 || I remember when they said Valhalla would be a little more focused than Odyssey, with less busywork. \\ud83e\\udd72 || Let's not pretend that gamers have problem with that, it's mostly sentiment just because it's Ubisoft, they would buy same slop from other studios || Don't have to if you played Far Cry 3. The basic gameplay loop is pretty much the same clear the outpost 50 times nonsense || Same system as Star Wars Outlaws. Question marks on your compass when you\\u2019re exploring, and other markers appearing when you get clues from\\nTalking to random NPCs. || No you didn\\u2019t? || Explaining \\u2260 them acting like they\\u2019re inventing it || Yeah it was awesome. Almost the entire industry (including Ubisoft) moved the opposite way by gamifying everything in the following decade. Far Cry 2 specifically went kinda nuts with wind simulation that affected fire propagation and that map. They even showed off vegetation regrowth in a demo, and I think some form of it made it in, but the stuff they were showing off was super cool.\\n\\nFar Cry 3 was great too, but it kinda sucks that the success of it stuck Ubisoft in that direction.\\n\\nNot to say every game needs a physical map, but in open-world games, the more a studio can do to bring the player closer to the character/remove unnecessary menu flipping, the better. UI elements and the map are an easy win IMO.\\n\\nIt's kinda wild to me that it took as long as it did for a game like Ghost of Tsushima to come out. The side activities are really not that much different from an AC game, they are just presented much more naturally (obviously the game has a ton of its own merits - it's great, but just the presentation of side activities alone was a breath of fresh air for people). || Or kill this corrupt evil \\u2026 whatever he is, who also happens to be a Templar. The lore framework is an epic conspiracy ideological struggle that spans millenniums, yet the best they can do for side quests are filler mustache twirling comical villains || I don't think anyone tired of same-y copypasted shit in open worlds is praising that part of Elden Ring or BOTW/TOTK or whatever.\\n\\nIt's not great anywhere. || [deleted] || Yup, most open world games tend to have this copy pasted issue like how Witcher 3 had repeated bandit camps, monster nests, guarded chest or how Ghost of Tsushima had the fox shrine and mongul camps. || Love that Elden Ring wastes my time by not showing Ive already killed a dungeon boss so I get to the boss arena only for it to be empty. || It is, but it at least has really, *really* good writing to back it up. Something Ubisoft solely lacks.\\n\\nThat said it also shares the same problems as Ubi games too, when people tell you that you can just disable so many UI elements, or enable an \\\"exploration mode\\\". Which is the fact that quests were designed *with* the markers in mind, and I have stumbled upon quests in Witcher 3 that don't give you any information beyond \\\"My friend's missing, can you find him?\\\" - guess what's the *only* thing that can point you towards the destination? || Sure if you're doing witcher contracts and literally nothing else. || All stories boil down to \\\"go to place, do thing\\\". \\n\\nIt's a writer's job to create a narrative that illudes the player enough to turn a \\\"Quest added: go and kill 5 wolves\\\" into an epic tale. || well that's just one game that released almost 10 years ago. ubisoft keeps releasing an inferior witcher 3 like every 2 years || The witcher sucks for me, tried 3 times but quit every time, love the new AC games but from what I've seen the witcher is the superior game story and dialogue wise, finished cp 2077 and it's the same, just superior story telling, you want to do everything bcs it is interesting, you don't just go somewhere to do something for a reword or to grind levels, you follow an interesting narative. I love AC bcs of history but damn do I cringe at some questionable narative and dialogue options || Personally liked Odyssey more, liked Cassandra a lot and really wanted to kill my brother lmao\\n\\nI also prefer the setting more, liked the ship system as well || I just got odyssey last month. I was debating between that and origins, but I thought greek mythology was slightly more interesting. The last ac game i played before this one was ac 3. I loved it at first. But I'm getting a bit burnt out. It's very samey. I'm doingbtue same thing over and over again. And the map is way too big. I've not explored much of it and I'm not looking forward to exploring more. || Odyssey was my personal favorite in the Ancient Trilogy. Not just because it was made by the same subdivision of Ubisoft that made Black Flag (hence the familiar ship battles and the same hilarious stealth bush exploits), but I also enjoyed the response the game had to your actions. Helping factions gain territory, bit by bit. And it was one of the only Assassins Creed games that didn't say \\\"This ancestor did not kill civilians\\\". You'd just get a bounty instead.\\n\\nAnd Valhalla was my second favorite. Granted, the story *did* feel longer than it really should've been but I loved the atmosphere it had. I *am* with the others who say the whole \\\"Asgard questline\\\" was kinda redundant. Heck, I didn't really understand it. Especially when >!Basim just suddenly goes rabid on you at the end of the game. Where the heck did that come from, unless... Was he the \\\"descendant of Loki\\\" like Eivor was the \\\"descendant of Odin\\\"? I haven't played Mirage yet but the title alone reinforces my theory since Loki is the god of mischief and *illusions*.!<\\n\\nOrigins? Desert = difficult to manage atmosphere and it appeared to me that they dropped the ball on delivering atmosphere for that game anyways. Combat was feeling very lackluster and the story felt even more \\\"textbook cult villain\\\" than Odyssey's Cult of Kosmos. I barely made it past the first chapter and into the first big city before I had enough. || I liked origins a lot but I liked origins more. I'm probably biased though  because I'm alot more interested in ancient Greece than I am in ancient Egypt. || Frankly, picking a game in that trilogy is more of \\\"are you a vikings fan, a greek myth fan, or egypt fan?\\\"\\n\\nI hated AC origins' level gating. Giving you a questline but breaking progression to force you to do side quests because enemies really get tougher 3 levels above.\\n\\nPeople remarked that odyssey has worse level gating but i never noticed it because the setting engaged me to explore and do quests. Ya know, like you are in the odyssey sailing around, or fulfilling labors like Heracles.\\n\\nValhalla got me excited for vikings, but that one was just bloated af. Ironically, odyssey is also bloated but it wasn't problematic. At least the main quest was separated into 3 quest lines.\\n\\nThey're not all bad games. I own all three, but it can be argued that you could be satisfied owning just one\\u2014hence why you pick according to your preference of the setting. || Personally I preferred Odyssey. I thought the main character was more likeable, the world was prettier, and the gameplay was better. \\n\\nOrigins tried really hard to be Witcher 3. It was clear the developers wanted people to fight enemies in melee out in the open, and the hidden blade was only there because it was still technically an Assassin's Creed game. In its big skill tree with over 60 skills, only three affect assassinations, and they're just instant loot and a bit more XP. Also the hidden blade barely dealt any damage to bigger enemies.\\n\\nOdyssey meanwhile had an entire third of its skill tree dedicated to stealth gameplay and assassinations, and you could get gear that boosts stealth damage. || >Hiding it all doesn't fix the problem of their game worlds being boring.\\n\\nAC Valhalla was the only one I found \\\"boring\\\"\\n\\nBut that was also 9th century England, so? || Only FromSoft could get away with such a terrible (nonexistent) quest system. Any other company would get demolished. || It's unfortunate. I love the idea of it, everything feels so mysterious and there is no hand holding, you really have to figure it out all on your own and it wouldn't feel like a from soft game any other way. But of course, eventually, you just end up looking it all up. Even the NPC markers they added later were an afterthought that it seemed like they didn't want to include, but were pressured to compromise, since they were trying to appeal to a much wider audience. || Somehow they managed to double down on it for the DLC too, since some of the side quests permanently break if you walk to the wrong spot before completing certain parts of them. At least in the base game you had to do obviously major things like kill gods to break the quests. Now its just oops walked across the wrong bridge. Bye bye quest. || A note system would go a long way. || >Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins\\n\\nNot to be confused with the Sepharahapharahada Dwemer ruins || I really miss this. || You make it out as a bad thing but I love Morrowind's immersive way of providing directions and I think many others feel the same. It's better than Elden Ring's way of doing it, which is not telling you at all where you can expect to encounter this character again next time, which is a requirement to advance the quest. || That's still way easier than Elden Ring. In that example even if you wander around a bit once you find that Dwemer ruin you at least know you're close just look for a cave opening near it. || Doesn\\u2019t Morrowind at least have a diary system? || \\u201cWe changed the map like six times after this description was written. Good luck.\\u201d || >\\\"I need you to kill some bandits in a cave. They're somewhere south of Sadrith Mora. ~~Go west from the boat dock until you see a rock shaped like a Kwama. Turn slightly south when the path turns north and climb over the ridge. If you've reached the water you've gone too far. Some ways past that you will find a shrine. Keep going until you find Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins, the cave should be near the third fallen tower.~~\\\"\\n\\nThat's how about how much info the player is given in the average elden ring quest. || That would be so much better than what Elden Ring does. || >With any luck players can also apply filters to display only what they want, or nothing at all.  I'd probably prefer to just filter the map to display nothing at all in an attempt to up the immersion to a maximum.  Maybe only display major settlements/ villages and castle towns etc.\\n\\nControlling how many map markers were available was already possible in the last games to some extent. || Yeah, I much prefer the checklist-like style of Ubisoft open worlds, to the lies that their \\\"exploration modes\\\" try to tell me.\\n\\nWhen you tell and show me that it's a checklist, I know what I'm getting into. And that's fine, sometimes I crave this simple, but entertaining enough game design.\\n\\nBut when you proudly display \\\"EXPLORATION MODE\\\" in the settings and marketing, that's what I expect. A mode that will let me explore the world, instead of going from one map marker to another, just in a slightly more tedious way. Because that's exactly what I found these modes to be, instead of \\\"Your target is in village X\\\", it says \\\"Your target is southwest of place X, surrounded by some hills and with a little campsite in the middle\\\". So you just look at your map and place a marker vaguely where you think this is and... Go there.\\n\\nOr follow the compass instead, which is basically the same thing. All this adds, is another step to end up with the same result and I really didn't like it. It wasn't different enough to warrant adding this step, nor was it difficult. || From the gameplay we've seen the game is littered in icones. || And that's why I listen to their reasoning and not just if they say it's good or not. || we have more game players now than ever, sales numbers mean very little since the early 2000's\\n\\n  \\ni remember people saying \\\"vote with yoru wallet\\\" before then and it didnt work... || No. Thankfully the eagle is removed in AC shadows. || People haven't read the blogpost explaining it.\\n\\nEssentially they're just time-gating everything.  Those time-gates are now called \\\"scouts\\\" (lol).  So you send scouts out (never physically, it's just menuing) to do \\\"intelligence gathering\\\" (select scouts, select region) and after some time passes, the invisible meter fills up and they come back with a map marker.  Unless you stumble across the discovery first.\\n\\nSo it's not really solving map clutter, it's just delaying it so it doesn't look cluttered.\\n\\nWhich is exactly the kind of solution that people who make games but don't play games would come up with. || No, the earlier games only revealed areas through viewpoints. The later AC2 games also dropped maps for collectibles after a point for completionists.\\n\\nEven Ghost of Tsushima, which Shadows is clearly trying to ride the coattails of, included in game ways to find all collectibles. I highly doubt Shadows is going to be as kind because they want those engagement numbers. || > The way it's described makes me worry they're just going to have icons not show up until you get near\\n\\n\\nThat's how Ghost of Tsushima did it and I hear no complaints about that. || As someone who has actually very much enjoyed many of the recent open world Ubi games, my biggest issue is with how general discovery is managed. I tend to play these games without just checking icon objectives off the map/list. I do just go the open exploration route. But what I'll run into are locations that obviously look as if I should be able to activate or access something. But those locations require me to first trigger a regional side quest first. That all needs to be redesigned. Like, it either needs to be obvious that I shouldn't waste my time trying to make something happen that straight up can't happen without a quest being active, or they need to redesign these mechanics so they can be accessed in any order and any time. And if you encounter an NPC who triggers a quest, ant you have already completed it, then you can interact with them in a realistic and dynamic way that completes the quest in that instance (like delivering a special item). Or maybe quests can be triggered from two points? You can either talk to the NPC who tells you where about to find an item, or you find the item and it tells you where to deliver it. || It sounds like Shadows is going to be more \\\"open world\\\" like Black Flag/Valhalla, so IMO it's a good thing to cut back on this as like you said it doesn't fit the design for that style of game.\\n\\n\\nThese are really just action games, the skilled, planned assassination identity was gone after AC2, now you just run and stab and shoot.\\u00a0 And when your design philosophy has both coined a term with a massive negative connotation (Ubisoft Towers) and become exceedingly unfun for players, it's a good thing to move on instead of trying to force it back in.\\n\\n\\nIf the identity of your games has become \\\"collect a billion repetitive map markers\\\" to the point the industry collectively groans when they see an open world map, it's an identity that needs to be reimagined to keep players engaged. || Imo 3 was the worst one\\n\\nI know a lot of people liked it but the setting made the whole rooftop stealth stuff that was so fun in the Ezio games completely disappear cause it was completely open between places.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve played all of them except Mirage and 3 is my least favourite \\n\\nValhalla doesn\\u2019t feel like an AC game but if you play it as if it isn\\u2019t then it is quite fun. You really need to commit to being a Viking and opting for big battles rather than forcing assassins stealth stuff which makes no sense in the universe || I actually hate the new RPG formula. My problems with the franchise were weak stories and poor mission design, but I felt the core gameplay was fine. || [deleted] || The team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are supposedly working on another Rayman, though there's nothing concrete yet. || Far Cry 2 was a sleeper game that could have been great if it weren't for the insanely short respawn timers for enemy bases. Like you could park up, clear out a checkpoint, go back to your car and drive through and the enemies would have respawned, it was wild. Made traversing the map a nightmare, which was a shame because the whole point was the open world. || Thing is Ubisoft have shown that they can write compelling villains in the past. Vass, Pagan Min, Haytham Kenway etc. but they just aren\\u2019t anywhere near consistent enough with it. || I'm not gonna praise it per se but at least every side-thing in Elden Ring had a reward. Be it a spell, an upgrade, a weapon... and since none are marked in the map I never had the urge to do them. I'd just walk around, see something curious in the distance and go check. || > You'll not find a copy pasted lava chariot dungeon anywhere else\\u00a0\\n\\nI want to say there's like 2 or 3 chariot dungeons actually. They're maybe a bit different in overall implementation but similar enough I couldn't actually tell you which was which. They blend together with time. || Well said. Just a little bit of integrating things with the world makes it feel better, even if it's fundamentally the same gameplay. Most quests in games boil down to \\\"Defeat # of X things\\\" but if you dress it up nice to the player, it's plenty palatable. \\n\\nI enjoy examples of quest descriptions in Monster Hunter games, even if most people don't read them. You get quests that range from \\\"Monster is causing havoc and mayhem on this road please help\\\" to \\\"This monster looked at my wife funny go kill it\\\" to \\\"The guildmarm really, really likes this punchy monster in a weird way please help research it\\\" || I have a theory Cassandra was the more engaging main character. Seems more that played her liked the game. || Yeah that was my problem with everything after origins, they just added too much bloat and I got bored of it. || >I've not explored much of it\\n\\nMan, you haven't even gotten to the normal good parts, not to mention all the cool dlc stuff.\\n\\n>And the map is way too big.\\n\\nYou don't need to explore everything, and remember that half the map is just water. \\n\\nJust set the game to easy, work on the big story stuff, explore what interests you, and you'll be happy you pushed through when you can run around with magical powers steamrolling everything in Ng+ || There are some very fun surprises you can accidentally stumble upon (some that play a major part of the story), if you know your Greek mythology and where to look\\u2026 || Odyssey is a bloated mess, idk how it escapes the criticisms Valhalla gets || Yes, your Basim theory is correct. But it was indeed confusing and poorly explained, had to look it up online myself || Yes, your Basim theory is correct. But it was indeed confusing and poorly explained, had to look it up online myself || They are \\\"sages\\\" which were introduced around Black Flag. (I honestly didn't really understood it at that time)\\n\\n\\nIn short: Several ISU (like Odin and Loki) put their memories into the DNA of human\\u00a0and then many years later in some human these memories emerge and might take over\\u00a0or merge with the mind of the person.\\n\\n\\nIn Valhalla you see Evoir resisting it and in the end also avoiding Odin. Basim on the other hand merged with Loki (before the events of Valhalla). But Loki wasn't sure Evoir was really Odin until the end. The Asgard quests explains Loki's hatred towards Odin (Loki had an affair and 3 illegitimate children of which one, Fenrir, was imprisoned by Odin). || Actually the Black Flag team(Montreal) developed Origins. And the Syndicate team(Quebec) was behind Odyssey. || I'm a big fan of both base settings but I liked Odyssey a bit more too. I think at least part of it is Origins isn't really \\\"ancient\\\" Egypt it's Ptolemaic Egypt, so Roman era Egypt essentially. Definitely an interesting historical time period but not quite the level of ancient vibes. || Thank you. I've said for years FromSoft gets a pass on things that from just about any other gaming company fans would (rightly) criticize them about. || It launched with unfinished quests. || Shit quest system, shit storytelling, very little reason to actually explore other than find bosses. But good fighting and beautiful world. \\n\\nIt has its pluses but unless you really enjoy the fighting just wandering around it was a super mid game. || * Opens youtube\\n* Search for Elden ring quest guides\\n* Videos with views like 8 million, 5 million, 4.2 million appear\\n* Organic quest design at its finest\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nI should have dropped some guide videos back in 2022 when the game launched, would have earned thousands of bucks\\u00a0 || There's a line between mysterious and obtuse though and I think sometimes FromSoft games lean a little too close to the latter. I have a whole rant on how the genre has issues that the fandom would not let slide from any other type of game but gets a pass; but that's for another thread. || After some time with the DLC, I'm glad the gaming public is finally starting to realize some of the things about FromSoft's design really aren't the greatest and it's time they smoothed certain things over. You can still be \\\"Dark Souls hard\\\" and not screw over the player with random bad luck. || Me when i spread misinformation:\\n\\nMiquella's rune breaking doesnt end any questline, it just starts all the quests. The only way to lock yourself out of quests is if you go to the last dungeon of the dlc without interacting with any npcs. || If they wanted to keep it organic without map markers, they could've included something like Morrowind's journal system, where it tells you what you did and where to look next for more information. || Ah yeah, that's next to the old Arkznclugbflelzth. || Not a bad thing at all, I much prefer it to Skyrim's point and click quest markers and fast travel system. Adds to the adventuring || Modern AC games are some of the best (modern) games when it comes to giving you directions that you don't need quest markers for || Morrowind had some quests like that as well. I remember one quest where it was like \\\"You'll find the guy in a cave northwest of Ald'ruhn.\\\" Northwest of Ald'ruhn is a big area, almost a quarter of the entire map. I searched for ages and found nothing before I looked it up. Turns out what they meant is \\\"north-north-north-northwest, and then as far as you can go before hitting the coast\\\". || Never said it wasn't.  Just hoping it is in AC Shadows.  I guess we can expect even the most basic filtering capability but wouldn't claim to know for sure.  It's the nothing at all option I'd be particularly fond of.\\n\\nI haven't played any of the AC games in quite a while so I don't really remember how extensive the filtering on the maps is. || I think we've seen very different gameplay...\\nCheck out some of the recently released gameplay. Everything looks way more polished and cleaner || That does help, though sifting through the lies is far from simple. I\\u2019ve never gotten the hang of getting any truth out of reviews at all. || That's how Witcher 3 did it too. Well it has a question mark to say *something* is there, but you have to get close to know what it is. || This is why I stopped listening to players complaining about games. A lot of times, they describe things they hate in games and then low and behold the games they love do the same thing but it's fine because its \\\"different\\\" lmfao || Ghost of Tsushima was utilizing the wind to direct players to new objectives, which is a very immersive way to do it. You can even be guided by the direction of the floating particles. That way you could move from one objective to the next without opening the map. \\n\\nNot a perfect system, but far preferable. || GoT was a tight map though with not a lot of empty space. In Valhalla and Mirage there was a ton of area where there was literally nothing there. Not to mention GoT used other ways to get the players attention to draw you to its activities like sign posts and foxes. Which again AC has only used map markers.\\n\\nSo I'm not too thrilled that there's every chance I'll just be wasting my time exploring certain areas. || Not really. No mini map and no symbols on your screen outside of the map. If something was near you a golden bird appeared and led you there and marked waypoints and story objectives were hinted at through a wind you could activate. Fells much more natural than a mini map with 20 question marks and other symbols. || Tbh, ghost of Tsushima was beautiful but in terms of an open world gameplay loop I felt it was really far behind an AC game probably as far back as AC 3. || [removed] || I appreciate how in God Of War, someone in the party will literally say \\u201clooks like you don\\u2019t have the right tools for this yet\\u201d which is soooo handy. || AC3 had the worst designed cities. Too much open space.\\n\\nAC4 which ran on the same engine had very fun cities. Havanna is one of my favourites in all of the games. || Valhalla as a Viking game was fantastic tbh. Play it without giving a shit about stealth and it\\u2019s a great time || Not really, it's based on the dev blog and leaves out most of everything\\n\\n[https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt) || Yeah that killed it. It was fun to fuck around in but for actually getting shit done, it made traversal a chore. || Makes some of em sound better than they were. Ghostwort was the reward a lot of the time. Or a recipe book in the expansion.\\n\\n>and since none are marked in the map I never had the urge to do them. I'd just walk around, see something curious in the distance and go check\\n\\nThat's fine and all but at the same time very crucial things were hidden among the so-so rewards. Namely the bells that would let you buy upgrade materials. Actually finding those organically would require throwing yourself at every side cave you found. || I read that Cassandra was supposed to be the only main character but management didnt like it so they had to add the male option || Definitely my preferred main character.\\n\\nThe fact she was the one they used for AC: Nexus points toward what you said being true. || I have played through as both Cassandra and Alexios, and thought the game was far more fulfilling as Cassandra. || Yeah, the only explanation I could come up with as to why the ending happened like that was because >!Basim/Loki was avenging his son Fenrir by killing Eivor/Odin. But the fact that *Eivor* was confused too just left me at skeptical instead of absolutely sure.!< || I'm aware of Black Flag's sage, but I had no idea this stuff with Basim and Eivor was *also* sage stuff. So Valhalla was to imply *multiple* sage lineages? Because yeah, Basim didn't really look like the sage in AC4, and the temple in that game provided the fact that sages retain their face throughout every lifetime. (Though with that detail I should've connected the same fact for Eivor and Basim. Bah, that one's on me lol)\\n\\nThough that does raise interesting questions then. Is a sage lineage how Abstergo managed to create the Animus in the first place? Studying a sage, follow the same \\\"ancestral link\\\" and replicate it for non-sage ancestries like Desmond Miles' ancestor, Ezio? || Tiollier Dragon Priestess route and Moores quests are both permanently broken by the Miquella Rune Break event if you don't know exactly how to work around it which you only have 1 chance at anyways. This essentially means that anyone going through blind has a very high risk of breaking multiple different characters quest-lines just by walking into the wrong spot. You can also lose access to all 6 pest cookbook missions depending on how you end up reacting with Moore and how far you were though them.\\n\\nThen you later on can permanently break parts of Hornsent and Leda's Questlines by walking into a boss room NOT EVEN DEFEATING IT JUST ENTERING. || Fast travel systems arent a problem, you can just not use them. Its good that they exist for players with less time and patience || Its a bit annoying tho, because it can be something boring. I remember going mark by mark when I started the game and giving up shortly || I feel like GoT had a lot less mundane shit than say Valhalla. If Shadows still has the raw quantity of boring whatever through the map it doesn't matter how it's discovered. And arguably GoT was way better written than some of recent Assassin's Creed games as well... people will forgive say 100 boring chests around Skellige if the plot of the game itself is good/engrossing (The Witcher 3). || Well you are wrong. GoT didn't do that. || Ghost was a boring slog of an open world with great combat. You aren't wrong. \\n\\nJust remember: Sony makes games for people who don't like playing games. || Cope harder. How about you play a game before saying shit that's wrong || True. I either want to be immediately notified that I cannot access something or be given the ability to access everything in any order. || I haven't played the older GoWs but the 2018 one (I really disliked it) treats players like morons tbh, this, the constant tips of Mimir on your hip after spending total time of 0.4 nanosecond on puzzle, I wouldn't be surprised if they added a tool to just let the game play by itself || Which is kinda a problem of the setting. Making early new York or Boston a tight knit crowded city where you possibly jump between buildings would be to make them look entirely unlike what they really looked like. Early NA colonies has more space than they knew what to do with Ave really spread out with mostly low buildings. \\n\\nGranted, they don't always make things look historically accurate. Valhalla looked entirely unlike what early medieval England looked like for example. To a really annoying degree for someone like myself who loves that time period and was looking forward to it. Stone everywhere. Castles churches, everything in stone. 970 AD almost everything was made of wood, I hated it. They also had all the soldiers in plate. Ridiculous. At that time you were rich if you could get chainmail. || It's also their most ahistorical looking game imo. Stone and plate armor everywhere. It's supposed to be 950 ad for pitys sake. || And who do you think is the DEV blog written by? || \\\"Ubisoft provided the info\\\"  \\n\\\"No they didn't. Here look at this [www.ubisoft.com](http://www.ubisoft.com) link.\\\"\\n\\nBruh, are you serious? || People on Reddit really struggle with critical thinking, don't they? || Malaka! || How... frustrating. || There's a little of that but also I think >!Basim/Loki was realizing Eivor is nearly at a point of fully awakening the Odin side and then she'd be an actual tangible threat to his current goals!< || Again, not disagreeing, just stating what I prefer. || That's the point of exploration though no? Sometimes you get something boring, sometimes you get something exciting, but the point is to explore to find out what it is. If you already know what it's going to be, why explore anything? Just head straight to what you want and ignore everything else. || That\\u2019s life my man. || Valhalla definitely had more mundane shit but GoT is still filled with it. Recently replayed it to get platinum and I started to hate the game because of the repetitive, boring side content, especially those stupid fucking foxes. || bruh GoT has ALOT of mundane shit, that's coming from a guy that 100% the map.\\n\\nboth my friends who play GoT at the same time stopped doing them and went straight through the story, while i stuck with it.\\n\\nso many usseles rewards aswell || Damn, I never heard better descriptor for modern sony exclusives, but I think You may be right lol || Look, I never said it was all that historically accurate. I just said it was fun lol || Not really. I liked W3 overall, but the map design was a pretty big drawback for me. Why not have fewer - but more impactful discoveries? It feels shitty (and goes against the intended level curve) not to work through any questionsmarks at all, but doing them felt like working off of some checklist instead of exploring the world. || I dont want to know whats going to be, but I do want to know if its something interesting. I liked the way Valhalla did it, I just plain skipped what I already knew wasnt worth my time and was meant for the completionists.\\n\\nI missed really cool stuff about the question markers in Witcher 3 because I got totally bored of chasing them. || Yeah I dont play games to be reminded how boring and disappointing life can be, I would prefer to have fun if you dont mind || I'm certainly not saying the filler content was good. Honestly it's bad across the entire open world genre. They've all got mind-numbing mundane shit crammed in and achieves, upgrades, or resources locked behind said mundane copypaste. \\n\\nJust few things are quite on Ubisoft's level in that regard. GoT isn't gonna take nearly as much time to plat as a number of open worlds. || I didn't say it didn't have mundane shit, it doesn't hold a candle to recent Ubi games in that regard though. Did you play Valhalla? The maps keep getting bigger and there's more and more \\\"?\\\" but less and less of actual interest. And it's not like the plot and side-quests were good enough to carry it. || Sony makes game for people who want to star in movies, not play games.\\n\\nI'm not judging. Just saying. || Fair, lol. I'm just one one about it, little salty. It's one of my favorite periods of history || But that's interesting or not depends on the person. I loved Gwent but wasn't a fan of monster nests. A friend of mine loved the nests but hated Gwent || I don't know, if I always know something is going to be interesting, then it's no longer interesting and the rest of the game becomes boring. It works in some games where there is no exploration involved, but if there's going to be, an air of mystery adds to that mechanic. || could say the same with GoT nearly every side quest started with following a npc then killing a group of enemies.\\n\\nand there were ALOT OF EM.\\n\\nanother reason why my friends rushed through the story, cause the sidequests ended up really repetitive || I dont agree. If something could be interesting but then its not, its just disappointing and I dont play games to be bored and disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

categories only) Sounds about right || personally i would pop Ben Star in best performance for clive in ffxvi that man absolutely killed it, and maybe swap out mario wonder for ffxvi in goty (if you couldn't tell, ffxvi was my goty) || Every winner here is spot on. Except I don\\u2019t think journalists appreciated Hi-Fi as much as you and I did. || What a year guys, what a year.. || Laura Bailey would likely be nominated for supporting role for MJ, not full performance. Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see!\\n\\nI also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them?\\n\\nalso does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers.\\n\\nThere are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY.\\n\\nStarfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot.\\n\\nFor best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War.\\n\\nI also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that\\n\\nAlso did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show.\\n\\nAnd yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation.\\n\\nMy vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it.\\n\\nI think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues.\\n\\nI'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract.\\n\\nOh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. \\n\\nMajor issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. \\n\\nYou'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. \\n\\nCompanions seriously need way more dialog. \\n\\nAnd the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough?\\n\\nSaying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot?\\n\\nI agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing.\\n\\nYour ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope.\\n\\nPeople say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. \\n\\nCome on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. \\n\\nYou don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly.\\n\\nWhat you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. \\n\\nThat said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said.\\n\\nLet me make this very clear for you.\\n\\nYou MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own.\\n\\nYou just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying.\\n\\nI pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me.\\n\\nSo the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to.\\n\\nEdit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part.\\n\\nYou also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies?\\n\\nEdit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol.\\n\\nYou've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog.\\n\\nYou also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either.\\n\\nThen you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money.\\n\\nThis isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues.\\n\\nIn short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said.\\n\\nThere is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of.\\n\\nIt also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it.\\n\\nEdit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?**\\n\\nI have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing.\\n\\nI have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld.\\n\\nI'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them.\\n\\nI created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations:\\n\\nArmored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series\\n\\nI must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews.\\n\\nI want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. \\n\\nSo I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. \\n\\nPreferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have.\\n\\nHere my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game.\\n\\nBut DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?\\n\\nYou don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now*\\n\\nYou just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome!\\n\\nI usually choose the games that I play depending on how I feel about the story presented in the trailer, if it makes me curious enough to want to know more about the game world and explore it. || Stay off news sites to avoid fomo. Play what you feel like playing || Elden ring was one of my favorite games in the last 5 years. It was so fun I played it through multiple times. It was my first souls like, then I went to Sekiro, which was also sensational. || Simple solution is to get more picky. There are not even hundreds of good games in my back, makes it easier to play just the ones I want || I usually have one game I play with friends (at present Diablo 4)\\n\\nThen another game I play through solo ( at present final fantasy xvi) \\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m not into side content in single player games Because  it just becomes a slog, I finish the story and move on to the next one. || In the time you written that story you could have just picked a game and played it. || simple - i play the money game.  \\ngaming is just a hobby - there are rarely any games that rise up to the metric of value in terms of time invested.     \\nin the last 5 years i've played cumulatively like around 2 months of in game time. so few games are worth spending time in, they're mostly just repetitive time sinks.  \\nlike this year for eg i've played only bg3 to completion. i drop so many games after just a couple of hours(good thing youtube exists coz i can just see how the game ended if the story was what was interesting).   \\n\\n>Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), **BG3**, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, **dishonored series**, divinity original sin 1,2,**Doom eternal**, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, **Kingdom Come Dliverance**, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, **Prey**, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, **sekiro**, subnautica, **SIFU**, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, **titanfall 2**, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series   \\n\\ni bolded the games in your \\\"must play\\\" list that are actually worth playing, the rest are supremely skippable time sinks or have insanely long gameplay loops or just time gate you by making you \\\"collect resources\\\".  \\nsome games are just good for story - i just watched the guardians of the galaxy game on youtube at 1.5x speed on second monitor while working and i don't think i missed anything by not playing it myself. same with horizon zero series and latest spoodermans. || Im doing a 10 year system so basically right now im playing 2013 and 202e summer stuff, in fall its gonna be fall 2023 and 2013 fall stuff etc some stuff takes a bit longer || Thats me right now. Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. \\n\\nSometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games.\\n\\nAs other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music.\\n\\nI have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something.\\n\\nAlso, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list.\\n\\nAnd highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say:\\n\\nIf you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games\\n\\nAnd:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D\\n\\nYou wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. \\n\\n3 was ehh for me personally. \\n\\nSo i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. \\n\\nAlso try going random if you like all the game types. Assassains creed will take over 1k hours to even beat them double or triple to 100% them. \\n\\nSo i geuss careful with what you sink your teeth into || Just play what you are in the mood for. Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly.\\n\\nEdit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. \\n\\nFor me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed.  Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice.  It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time.  I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed. Get hooked on one at a time. Focus. || Did you reach the owl boss?

categories only) Sounds about right || personally i would pop Ben Star in best performance for clive in ffxvi that man absolutely killed it, and maybe swap out mario wonder for ffxvi in goty (if you couldn't tell, ffxvi was my goty) || Every winner here is spot on. Except I don\\u2019t think journalists appreciated Hi-Fi as much as you and I did. || What a year guys, what a year.. || Laura Bailey would likely be nominated for supporting role for MJ, not full performance. Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see!\\n\\nI also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them?\\n\\nalso does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers.\\n\\nThere are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY.\\n\\nStarfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot.\\n\\nFor best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War.\\n\\nI also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that\\n\\nAlso did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show.\\n\\nAnd yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation.\\n\\nMy vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it.\\n\\nI think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate\\n\\n\\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues.\\n\\nI'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently.\\n\\nIt'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract.\\n\\nOh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. \\n\\nMajor issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. \\n\\nYou'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. \\n\\nCompanions seriously need way more dialog. \\n\\nAnd the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough?\\n\\nSaying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot?\\n\\nI agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing.\\n\\nYour ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope.\\n\\nPeople say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. \\n\\nCome on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. \\n\\nYou don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly.\\n\\nWhat you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. \\n\\nThat said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said.\\n\\nLet me make this very clear for you.\\n\\nYou MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own.\\n\\nYou just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying.\\n\\nI pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me.\\n\\nSo the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to.\\n\\nEdit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part.\\n\\nYou also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies?\\n\\nEdit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol.\\n\\nYou've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog.\\n\\nYou also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either.\\n\\nThen you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money.\\n\\nThis isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues.\\n\\nIn short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said.\\n\\nThere is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of.\\n\\nIt also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it.\\n\\nEdit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?**\\n\\nI have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing.\\n\\nI have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld.\\n\\nI'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them.\\n\\nI created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations:\\n\\nArmored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series\\n\\nI must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews.\\n\\nI want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. \\n\\nSo I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. \\n\\nPreferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here.\\n\\nHere's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have.\\n\\nHere my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game.\\n\\nBut DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?\\n\\nYou don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now*\\n\\nYou just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome!\\n\\nI usually choose the games that I play depending on how I feel about the story presented in the trailer, if it makes me curious enough to want to know more about the game world and explore it. || Stay off news sites to avoid fomo. Play what you feel like playing || Elden ring was one of my favorite games in the last 5 years. It was so fun I played it through multiple times. It was my first souls like, then I went to Sekiro, which was also sensational. || Simple solution is to get more picky. There are not even hundreds of good games in my back, makes it easier to play just the ones I want || I usually have one game I play with friends (at present Diablo 4)\\n\\nThen another game I play through solo ( at present final fantasy xvi) \\n\\n\\nI\\u2019m not into side content in single player games Because  it just becomes a slog, I finish the story and move on to the next one. || In the time you written that story you could have just picked a game and played it. || simple - i play the money game.  \\ngaming is just a hobby - there are rarely any games that rise up to the metric of value in terms of time invested.     \\nin the last 5 years i've played cumulatively like around 2 months of in game time. so few games are worth spending time in, they're mostly just repetitive time sinks.  \\nlike this year for eg i've played only bg3 to completion. i drop so many games after just a couple of hours(good thing youtube exists coz i can just see how the game ended if the story was what was interesting).   \\n\\n>Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), **BG3**, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, **dishonored series**, divinity original sin 1,2,**Doom eternal**, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, **Kingdom Come Dliverance**, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, **Prey**, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, **sekiro**, subnautica, **SIFU**, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, **titanfall 2**, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series   \\n\\ni bolded the games in your \\\"must play\\\" list that are actually worth playing, the rest are supremely skippable time sinks or have insanely long gameplay loops or just time gate you by making you \\\"collect resources\\\".  \\nsome games are just good for story - i just watched the guardians of the galaxy game on youtube at 1.5x speed on second monitor while working and i don't think i missed anything by not playing it myself. same with horizon zero series and latest spoodermans. || Im doing a 10 year system so basically right now im playing 2013 and 202e summer stuff, in fall its gonna be fall 2023 and 2013 fall stuff etc some stuff takes a bit longer || Thats me right now. Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. \\n\\nSometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games.\\n\\nAs other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music.\\n\\nI have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something.\\n\\nAlso, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list.\\n\\nAnd highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say:\\n\\nIf you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games\\n\\nAnd:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D\\n\\nYou wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. \\n\\n3 was ehh for me personally. \\n\\nSo i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. \\n\\nAlso try going random if you like all the game types.

Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly.\\n\\nEdit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. \\n\\nFor me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed.  Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice.  It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time.  I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed.

Got a week until MGS comes out so would like to try and beat something before it takes over the next month of my life\\n\\nAll on PC\\n\\n* Shadow of Mordor (Played on PS4, really liked it, only got a few hours in before other games took over)\\n\\n* Wolfenstein (Played a tiny bit and it looked good, probably the shortest game)\\n\\n* Dragon Age: Inquisition (Loved DA:O and enjoyed DA2, might be a bit too long to enjoy in just one week)\\n\\n* Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity (Both look interesting, I've only ever played Asscreed 2 and it took me months to complete because it was really dull to me, but heard great things about the later games) Out of all of those, I enjoyed the story of Black Flag the most. But I would not recommend you play it if you're looking to complete it in a week. I would recommend a slow play of the game to take in the role of being a pirate to it's fullest.\\n\\nWolfenstein has a great story that's not too long but not too short.

Rest of these are pretty spot on but I guess we\\u2019ll see! I also know Alan Wake 2 probably won\\u2019t be GOTY (it\\u2019s mine though) it needs to win *something* because my god it\\u2019s so good. || Are we really nominating Super fucking Mario over Armoured core 6 for game of the year? It's actually crazy how this game has flown under everyones radar. And I think games like Spider man 2 and the RE4 remake don't even deserve to be mentioned. Spider man 2 is glorified DLC, playing and looking near exactly the same as Spider man 1 and the miles morales spin off, and RE4 is a remake, which should have its own category. It's inherently different as it reuses map designs, storylines, etc, and shouldn't be compared with brand new debuts. || I am curious on how the real list will look like, hopefully some indie games like Cassette Beast will see some recognition. || is this for a specific game award show/program/list or like for overall all of them? also does anyone still do a stupid \\\"Most Anticiapted Award\\\"? || I laughed at Hogwarts Legacy as a 'family' game. No, the MC kills as many people as in assassin's creed\\ud83d\\ude02 || [removed] || [deleted] || I'm typically against GOTY awards and think most years shouldn't have any hosted due to the games having significant issues or not comparing well to their predecessors or genre-peers. There are some good games this year, but like always they have many significant issues. So its hard to really ... rate any of them as GOTY. Starfield, trashy game as it is, is also not an action adventure it's an action rpg and thus in the rpg department. || You misspelled Metroid Prime Remastered at least 2 dozen times. || Great post, well put together. || There are so many great games this year that I forgot some of the games on this list were released this year. || I hope FFXVI receives at least 1 award. I know it's not the strongest game this year, but the developers but a lot of heart in that game. || I guess the Silksong anticipation died down at this point? || I swear to God if Alan wake gets no rewards this year I'm gonna vomit || I think Lies of P cuts ahead of either Pizza tower or Blasphemous 2. More than 1 million copies sold and it was a huge hit. Also wish games like halls of torment were given a chance but this year was jam packed. || I don't really agree with those most anticipated titres. Nobody seems to care about Skull and bones and Prince of Persia got heavily disliked when it was annonced. I think Star wars outlaws and Tekken 8 would take their spot. For best fighting Games I think you could make a case for Nickelodeon all star brawl 2 instead of Clash, it seems to be much more better than the first game. || I would swap FF16 and Starfield's places in RPG and action adventure respectively. Also, I admit I kind of hope Elba's not nominated for performance. He's already famous and gets so many awards, it'd be nice for smaller actors to get some time to shine. || Having Laura Bailey nominated for Best Performance over Nadji Jeter as Miles is WILD! She does a great job as per usual but she doesn\\u2019t even give the best supporting performance if you ask me. (That goes to Jim Pirri as Kraven imo.) || Except Starfield should be in the RPG category, and FFXVI should be in the action game category. Yeah the title would suggest it's an RPG but actually play the game and prove me wrong. If FFXVI is an RPG, then so is Devil May Cry and God of War. I also wouldn't put Bayonetta Origins as a \\\"family\\\" game, and certainly not before Zelda. It just looks like he simply looked at Nintendo's release schedule for 2023 without much thought beyond that Also did he forget Baldur's Gate III is also multiplayer? Exoptimal gets a nom before BGIII? Same can be said for Super Mario Bros Wonder || Strong 87 on metacritic. I think noms for art direction, score, and audio are in the realm of possibility. || Probably the best one since 17/18 right? || I agree. I can\\u2019t see her getting nominated over Nadji Jeter as Miles after his stellar performance. Laura was great as she always but tbh I don\\u2019t think she even gave best supporting performance in the game. I think Jim Pirri as Kraven did. || At the end of the day, even though I enjoyed the game, AC6 is still a niche title that not everyone will get into. Mario on the other hand well.... do I need to say more || It's for the game awards game awards show. And yes the game awards does do Most Anticipated || I\\u2019d say it\\u2019s neck and neck. Baldur\\u2019s Gate 3 may edge out because it was a \\u201cbreath of fresh air\\u201d in a time where triple A games were getting stiff. Tears of the Kingdom is awesome, but it\\u2019s more of a fan pleaser \\u2014 we loved Breath of the Wild, so they essentially gave us BotW 2; it\\u2019s exactly what I asked for and wanted, but it\\u2019s also not breaking new ground on an awards show looking for freshness and innovation. My vote will go to Tears of the Kingdom, but I think Baldur\\u2019s Gate is winning it. I think that\\u2019s a good thing though, I remember when Breath of the Wild won it, it was pretty much an undisputed champion. Elden Ring too, its only meaningful competition was God of War. It\\u2019s not fun when one game is clearly going to win, means that year wasn\\u2019t great. || >I personally think Tears of the Kingdom is going to beat out Baldur's Gate \\ud83d\\ude02 || I could see FF16 getting in over Mario. If Zelda hadn\\u2019t also come out this year, I think Mario would be a lock for a nomination. But the Nintendo vote being split between two games will definitely hurt its odds. Zelda and Mario both got nominations in 2017 but that was for two better received games. || [removed] || Name a significant issue with BG3, Armoured core 6, lies of P, Alan wake 2, etc. You can't, anything you might not like is personal preference, not an actual fault in the game. Sure Starfield and some others were terrible, with objective issues like performance issues and the like, but that doesn't take away from the achievements of other games. || Remasters historically haven\\u2019t gotten nominated at the game awards. Only full remakes. || [deleted] || I agree. People seem to be calling FFXVI an RPG simply because of the title || [removed] || I didn't say there were not good games released, I mentioned they had significant major issues, including almost every in this list. You seem to b e the type who can't handle criticism. And no this has not been one of the best years of games in history. It WOULD HAVE BEEN for a few genres at least, if all these issues were non existent. But regarding performance issues, graphical issues, stuttering issues, dialog issues, regression of quality in favor of quantity, not being developed enough and numerous other factors, no... there are many issues. I'd say most these games deserve a 7 or 8 but probably leaning more to the seven. I can't rate every single one tho. Not currently. It'd be nice if we could get more story and singleplayer focused games without a mountain of issues or major significant issues that detract. Oh and Survivor is still pretty much constantly stuttering in the background when playing so.. that's still unplayable. || You have to be pretty craZy to think significant issues don't exist and then try to handwaves the potential of significant issues by claiming any issues are personal. Like you just admitted you're incapable of criticism. Major issues such as performance issues in Act 2 and 3? The severe dialog drought wherein over a two hundred hours video game the vast majority of the time your companions will have almost nothing new to say and the rare times they do it's gated by a major quest but even that new dialog disappears quick? The major lack of atmospheric dialog and the entirely unforgivable removal of player agency with reaction dialog you can't follow up or ask about again or continue discussion with when companions react mostly generically and infrequently? Reaction dialog in itself is a sin equal to Mass Effect 3s automatic dialog which made your character talk on his own and remove player agency. In BG3 reaction dialog doesn't let your player say anything about what's going on when the companions react. It's a major rob of player agency and unforgivable. The fact one of the major antagonists in bg3 such as Gortash has some of the most contradictory and plot hole centric dialog and his writing quality is akin to a high school freshmen writing fan fiction with no respect towards the things already established in the game is another sign. You'll dismiss these but as a story rpg they're all immensely major. Not to mention the entirely plot hole driven and contradictory ending that doesn't work within the BG and D and D framework of lore and how things work. Companions seriously need way more dialog. And the issues of other games are just as significant and driven as that. Though almost every one has major performance issues that are more than just a few bugs. Now go troll elsewhere. || Then why is it all over your list || Both Zelda and Spiderman were glorified DLCs. However there is a grim possibility that one of them might get enough votes to win GOTY, due to console exclusivity. For some reason I still cant understand, exclusivity is a huge deal to some console players. || [removed] || That is a ridiculous expectation. Do you really expect there to always be new dialogue you can access every time you talk to someone? What world are you living in? Voice actors have to be paid, a lot. It's a miracle already with the sheer amount of dialogue. I mean holy shit there are around 174 hours of sheer cutscene and dialogue in Baldurs gate 3, but that isn't enough? Saying there is no player agency is just stupid, you cannot predict exactly what every player will want to say/do in a specific situation, you can only take a numerous amount of general reactions and hope the player aligns with one. Because then you would have to record voice lines for every bit of dialogue imaginable. And that isn't realistic. Additionally, of all games, player agency is most present in BG3, you can do almost anything, kill any NPC, find multiple ways around quests, be good or evil, what ever you want. But that isn't enough because you clicked through the dialogue, ended the conversation, and then got annoyed that the character wouldn't repeat the conversation like a robot? I agree that the writing is shabby, but that isn't a 'major issue', the appeal of BG3 is the freedom, we all know that the dnd world is full of crappy writing. Your ludicrous expectations are not a fault on the game. Companions already have an unbelievable amount of dialogue that was likely VERY expensive. And the game does not have performance issues. Games can't be expected to keep supported outdated hardware. The game runs great on my mid-high tier system, and it shouldn't be expected to support older hardware for a game of its scope. People say I have high expectations, but holy shit man you must just not like games. || [removed] || Yes actually it does when the issues ARE MAJOR. And they are all games with MAJOR issues. Some games have major issues that define their genre being degraded, such as BG3 having much dialog droughts for its companions wherein the vast majority of the time they are silent during a 200 hour comprehensive playthrough, then the writing, ending, and story issues found in Act 3, plus major performance issues as well. The minor bugs or the fact you can be locked out of romance, or some tiny graphical issue here or all the items that are inaccessible due to being unable to be clicked htose are minor and should only lightly take away from score. But the major ones? No. &#x200B; You're just used to issues being very rarely weighted with any real significance. When they should be. Scores are highly inflated. || You're distorting heavily what I said and clearly reading into it what you want, not what was said. I never even indicated how much more dialog specifically was necessary merely indicated the severe drought in a major story companion focused rpg. Come on you're just trolling now if you can't even reply to what's said rather than assuming distorting and replying to what isn't said. You don't even know what my expectations are because you clearly don't know how to reply or read honestly. What you're doing is called lying. And I'm not sure who you're talking to since none of your reply was directed to me but a fictitious non existent version of yourself arguing with yourself. || Dont worry, I am not saying they are bad DLCs. In fact both are top tier DLCs. They are just not new games. Same visuals, same graphics, same core gameplay, same environments, same characters. Of course they feature new story and additional abilities. That said Witcher 3: Blood and Vine was a DLC that had a whole new map. But comparing anything to Witcher 3 is unfair. || [removed] || Bro you are a nutcase. You complain about there not being enough dialogue, I say that's wrong, and now I'm lying because apparently you didn't say that \\\"companions seriously need more dialogue\\\". || False. But you've demonstrated you think criticism or having thoughts against you is the same as shitting. Criticism is the life blood of progress. It's vital. You.. seem incapable of recognizing that basic facts. It is pitiful. All of your statement is.. nonsensical. || That's not what you said though. You replied to something no one said. Let me make this very clear for you. You MUST learn to quote people. NOT to paraphrase. NOT to distort. NOT to assume. NOT to modify their words with your own. You just quote and you reply in context to what people say. Replying out of context is akin to lying. I pointed out the issues of why and where dialog is droughted at. You instead just handaved because you were arguing with yourself not me. So the question is what did Helphaer \\\\*literally\\\\* say? And what was the context of what I \\\\*literally\\\\* said. And thus as a result what should you \\\\*literally\\\\* reply to. Edit: Also you dismissed performance issues claiming it was only for weaker systems which is definitely not true as performance issues and frame issues have bene discussed innumerably and frequently for all systems, from the RTX30 to the 40 series and to other forms. That's just an immature response on your part. You also tried to dismiss issues in a story rpg as if writing didn't matteer.. in a story rpg. || [removed] || But you did say that? You said that \\u201ccompanions seriously need way more dialogue\\u201d. That is a direct quote. I say that is ludicrous considering how much they already have, and factoring the sheer amount of dialogue in other parts of the game. Again, 174 hours of cutscene and dialogue. I don\\u2019t get you, you complain about companion dialogue, I say the game has plenty and you are expecting too much, you say player agency is limited in dialogue options, I explain that of all games BG3 has the highest degree of player agency in a game of its kind, but apparently I\\u2019m not addressing your argument? And now I don\\u2019t even know what I said, I am saying that it is wrong to say BG3 doesn\\u2019t have enough companion dialogue, I have been saying that it is a ridiculous cultus expectation, how on earth are you claiming that I didn\\u2019t say that? Did you read any of my replies? Edit: also I said that the writing was shabby, there are definitely points where you notice it being off or weird. But that isn\\u2019t a major issue in a game like BG3, that\\u2019s an issue with the individual. I\\u2019m not playing it for the story, so it doesn\\u2019t affect me. It\\u2019s inherently subjective so it can\\u2019t disqualify the game for the game awards || I literally made criticism. Do you want an essay cause I'm willing to do so lol. You've just been using distortions, attacks and ad hominems. You've got less than zero credibility as a result. It's somewhat disappointing. Childlike. || Yes, but I also said a lot more than that, applied context, indicated where they needed it and why etc. You instead decided to mention the amount of dialog in game already, but that's irrelevant, one because companions aren't the only type with dialog in the game, and two because we were talking about companion dialog. You also went out of context in reaction dialog and followup, a staple of dialog systems in almost any rpg. To the point that in no story-game within my entire life have I ever encountered before BG3 a situation where dialog was had which did not allow some kind of follow up or feedback if it wasn't very generic as a game. This is a serious removal of player agency, just as auto-matic dialog in ME3 was considered a horrendous removal of player agency. Both of these were never seen before those instances, and thankfully haven't again. I hope this idea never is seen again either. Then you tried to act like you couldn't account for all things to reply with, but given the subject matter of the game, you very much CAN account for what the specific thing going on in an event that a companion is reacting to might l lead a reply with. And it's MUCH EASIER when you have a non voiced protagonist, which removes most excuses as well. As they could literally say anything and it would cost no additional money. This isn't new for Larien though, they've always struggled with the companion development and story-systems of an rpg, mainly focusing on their unique combat style using elements and such. Which is their kind of gimmick in DOS 1 and DOS 2, and in older Divinity games they had their own issues. In short, there was a lot of distortion of context by you and it still seems like your replies aren't registering what is actually being said. There is absurdly low dialog from your companions throughout a full playthrough, and the dialog that does exist is either very rare, or is reaction dialog which is significant, but removes all player-agency by allowing no reaction, interaction, or follow-up back at camp or another time. It also as such is typically pointless. Most players would likely prefer more dialog than dialog they have no part of. It also shows heavily that BG3 did not have Act 2 and Act 3 in their early access, given the many issues from it. Edit: The issues in the systems aren't subjective. This is a story-rpg it should be judged as one, it is also a game it should be judged as that, it's also a title that had 3 years to get things right via early access and it needs to be judged by that as well. Finally it's the spiritual successor to old-style BioWare's Baldur's Gate 2 and as a result it needs to follow that up, which was a companion-focused story rpg.\",\n          \"I am suffering from choice overload: so many good games to play, so little free time **TL;DR: How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play?** I have over the last several years completed RDR2, persona 5 royal, cyberpunk base game, bloodborne, LOU 1,2, zelda BOTW, TOTK, stardew valley, the forest 1, nier series, hogwarts legacy, fallout 3,NV, 4, dying light and they were amazing. I have put many hours in ark survival and rimworld. I'm the type who usually pick a game, play it until it's completed and move on to the next one. However, there are few exceptions. I have started skyrim, valhalla, subnautica but have not completed it. I am planning to return to them in the future when I feel like playing them. I created a must play gaming list over the years by looking through online reviews/recommendations: Armored Core 6, the Ascent, Assassin's creed series (all of them including odyssey, origins, valhalla), BG3, bioshock series, control, cyberpunk 2077 new dlc, dead island 2, death stranding, detroit- become human, devil may cry 5, disco elysium, dishonored series, divinity original sin 1,2, Doom eternal, Dredge, elden ring, Far Cry 3, FF VII remake Intergrade, the Forgotten city, ghost of tsushima Ghostwire-Tokyo, Hades, Half life series, Hellblade, Hitman series, Hollow knight, Horizon zero series, immortals Fenyx Rising, , Kena Bridge of Spirits, Kingdom Come Dliverance, Life is Stange series, Mafia series, Marvels Guardians of the galaxy, mass effect series, no man's sky, Ori series, outer wilds, outer worlds, Prey, Remnant II, Resident evil remake 2,3,4; RE 7, village, Returnal, rise and shadow of tomb raider, sekiro, subnautica, SIFU, skyrim, sleeping dogs, spiderman series, starfield, titanfall 2, uncharted series, wasteland 3, witcher 3, Wo long, Yakuza and Judgement series I must say sometimes I feel overwhelmed as I would like to get and play all the games in the list but I know it's impossible as I am a full time worker with family. By the time I finish one game, few more good games are released. This will become a never ending list! I really wish there was a real world hyperbolic time chamber where I can play all these games! I have tried resorting to choosing few of the best games from the list, and adding newer good games as they are released. But I can't make a decision to what to play because they all have good reviews. I want to hear how other people choose their games to play out of many good games that are released when you don't have alot of time to play? I'm also open to critiques about my game list! &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; You don't have to play everything right now, it's ok to be late to games. So I'd say just start playing through the Yakuza/Like a Dragon games and you'll soon forget that other games even exist. Then once you're done you can calmly move on to try and fill that yakuza void with other games. Preferably new Like a Dragon games since we got 3 of them on the way. || That's about 90% of anyone here. Here's a suggestion, don't start with the lowest hours of playtime (for exemple dont start with smaller games just to clear your backlog) just play the one game that stands out of every games you have. Here my other advice : if it's fun, stick to it. and DONT start a new game. you will never finish anything like that. IF it's not as fun as you had liked, stop and change game. But DONT start 2 games at the same time. || I play in rotation. Lots of games depending on the mood. For example i started rome expeditions when it came out, went to the second part but due to relocation, marriage etc... I'm continuing to the 3rd and final part now. So... rotation. I got Metal Gear 5 and baldur's gate 3 too.... 3 missions a day for MG5, few quests for BG3 another day. Chill || >How do you choose a game to play out of millions of good games out there when you don't have alot of time to play? You don't have to play all of them, and you don't have to play all of them *now* You just listed a bunch of games that are positively received. Screw the crowd's opinion, what do **you** want to play? || you should add prince of persia the two thrones to the list || A hyperbolic time chamber for gaming would be awesome!

Game I still haven't touched at all but still hope to play include GoW Ragnarok, Elden Ring, Ghost of Tsushima, Hogwards Legacy, BG3, Persona 5. Sometimes I feel like it's impossible to keep up with all the releases. Some I may just forget about and never play || I totally understand this. FOMO is an easy trap to fall into when there are so many good games. As other commenters have mentioned, there's no hurry or necessity to finish them, but at the same time I know the obsession of trying to complete as much as possible. This can cause burnout when you put too much pressure. Go slow and accept that you don't need to play every game, just like not listening every artist or type of music. I have a habit of installing a bunch of games based on what genre I'm into at the moment, trying them all parallelly and continue with the one I liked. I usually don't like to play similar type of games back to back. I also make lists on how long to beat and decide based on how many hours it takes to beat, as most often I don't have the patience to spend 100 hours on something. Also, I'd add metal gear rising revengeance, dark souls series (atleast 1 and 3) to the list. And highly recommend outer wilds. Don't read anything about it beforehand, if you play to try it. || Well. I can safely say: If you want to play a well modded skyrim, ff7 remake intergrade, the first five assassins creed games And:still want to live, eat, work, have a shower here and then - its gettin complicated :D You wont get it done in a year :P || Mafia 1&2 are really fun games. 8-15 hrs depending on what difficulty for each. 3 was ehh for me personally. So i do highly recommend them out of everything on your list. Fairly quick and enjoyable || I also enjoy watching a few hrs of gameplay to see if its a game id even be interested in playing. Useally skip through the prolog. Also try going random if you like all the game types. Assassains creed will take over 1k hours to even beat them double or triple to 100% them. So i geuss careful with what you sink your teeth into || Just play what you are in the mood for. Otherwise it will start feeling like a chore pretty quickly. Edit: autocorrect || Honestly never had issues with this, you just have to be more picky. Trust me I know its hard to, but try to imagine which of these games deserves your time and money the most. For me I only have one must play type of games, and its a Fromsoft release, everything else has to work for it. || I try to be selfish and pick what I want the most as if it could be my last. I can also wait a long time to play but that's part of being selfish, wanting the game to be in its best state. With that said I try to throw myself some curveballs now and then but this method has worked for me, I've been finishing more games || Agreed. Recently it's been a good time in particular for RPGs and I find myself spoiled for choice. It just comes down to what genre you want to play and which game looks like it has the aesthetics and gameplay you're in the mind for at the time. I find looking at both playthroughs of different games and sometimes tip videos help, I remember looking at hints for Resident Evil 4 Remake and suddenly knew I had to start playing it. || Save some thumb strength for retirement if you\\u2019re well off enough to stop working before you are dead. || I feel you, I definitely do and I think most people can relate. What I suggest you do is try to narrow down a specific genre and prioritize those games, after that just go with your gut instinct. For me, I like RPGs, Bethesda games are my favorite so I also looked at Kingdome Come and Cyberpunk which fit into that open world first-person RPG niche. I like open world games in general so games like RDR2 or Horizon are a must-play for me at some point in the future. || I agree with you completely absolutely and I agree with your perspective. || [deleted] || Agreed. Get hooked on one at a time. Focus. || Did you reach the owl boss? I got stuck there.\",\n          \"1 week until MGS - Should I play Shadow of Mordor, Wolfenstein, Dragon Age: Inquisition or Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity? Got a week until MGS comes out so would like to try and beat something before it takes over the next month of my life All on PC * Shadow of Mordor (Played on PS4, really liked it, only got a few hours in before other games took over) * Wolfenstein (Played a tiny bit and it looked good, probably the shortest game) * Dragon Age: Inquisition (Loved DA:O and enjoyed DA2, might be a bit too long to enjoy in just one week) * Assassin's Creed Black Flag/Unity (Both look interesting, I've only ever played Asscreed 2 and it took me months to complete because it was really dull to me, but heard great things about the later games) Out of all of those, I enjoyed the story of Black Flag the most. But I would not recommend you play it if you're looking to complete it in a week. I would recommend a slow play of the game to take in the role of being a pirate to it's fullest. Wolfenstein has a great story that's not too long but not too short. Complete this game and move on to Black Flag in the future when you have time. || Shadow of Mordor or Wolfenstein. Both are brilliant and you don't really have time to play the others if you only have a week. || Black Flag is a really good game. But I absolutely recommend Shadow of Mordor over any of these. You don't need to play DA:I. Not until you're entirely out of games.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ready_text\",\n      \"properties\":

I'm an Oblivion fan boy myself, but I can't deny that the games slowly started losing hard RPG mechanics and rep systems.

It's a fun twist on metroidvania || I see nothing wrong with this list, good taste, should try bloodborne, the thematic just beats all the other from games || Did we just become best friends!!?!! || Based on what I see here, I would recommend Hollo might like itw Knight.

I would do DS3 before Elden ring. DS3 is a better balanced and more linear experience. (I personally think it\\u2019s the best game ever made from a gameplay experience) and then do Elden ring (I\\u2019m in the minority that thinks it\\u2019s their 4th or 5th best title). The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous. My order of best to worst is probably DS3, bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Demon souls, Dark souls, Ds2 || i mean theres no need to to buy them at 60. if you play on pc they often go on sale. both ds3 and ds2sotfs go on 75% off and ds1 remastered goes on 50% off. next sale i would pick them up if you think youll like that style of game. || I used [this](https://www.fotor.com/features/collage) website || Well he likes fromsoft and bloodborne is their best game || I love all their final updates! They're so good. || The top 2 rows is telling me you were blue team all along lol. Hope you get one soon. || Get a ps5. The demons souls remake was worth it alone for me.

PUT THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THE TITLE! || What are you talking about?

Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. \\n\\nNot a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. \\n\\nTo compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. \\n\\nIf I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care.\\n\\n\\nThe best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin?\\n\\nAlso that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received).\\n\\nHow does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed.\\n\\nOn top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused\\u00a0character.\\u00a0Naoe is stealth focused.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nOn top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit.\\n\\nWhat's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much\\n\\ndude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. \\n\\nUsually it's best to give the game title in these little vague  posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had:\\n\\n* Italian dude in Italy\\n* English dude in America\\n* Egyptians in Egypt\\n* Greeks in Greece\\n* Vikings in Norway, and England\\n\\nBut they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones.\\n\\n  \\nNone of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story. For a writer of historical fiction, it doesn't get better as using Yasuke. || Anyone is a better main character than him. They literally had the entirety of japanese history and they found the one black dude who was a footnote in their history and made him the protagonist so they didn't have to cast an Asian dude || Yes. Ubisoft is full on let's appease the masses and not get cancelled because we don't make decent games any more. || forced to play as someone you can't stand listening taking about virtues and righteousness knowing well those are lies anyone who kills with smile on their face like this is a psychopath. || No, he's a better character so it would stick even more when they raceswap him. || Yeah bro I was like umm is there a kill bill game I missed? || I miss the old rule of putting the game in brackets in the post title. || Assassin's Creed Shadows || Maybe as a villain probably like a rival shinobi clan hunting them. || He probably won't be able to, only Naoe the shinobi will do it. || It seems based on the trailer that it's  Yasuke is combat focused and the other character is stealth focused. Not sure how that's going to play into the game. || He will definitely not be the stealth type playable character. || James Bond managed pretty well in that one movie right?...right? || I don't see this to be an issue when the blend in mechanic is kinda unrealistic in other ACs too. I mean you wear the craziest outfits so this wouldn't be a good way to hide anyway. || Thats actually what makes him a good  contender for a playable character. || I'm concern how they gonna adapt Yasuke into the environment with the dialogue as well. || The issue is that he has the wrong background. || Wasn't Ad\\u00e9wal\\u00e9 loosely based on Black Caesar? || The opinion that should have been considered in the dev rooms. || The game you want is called Ghost of Tsushima and came out some time ago. This entire comment of yours reads like \\\"I hate ubisoft\\\" and that's fine, but don't hide behind fake outrage and victimhood. || I appreciate you.   \\n  \\nIt's not a bad thing that they're running with Yasuke (he is a pretty cool and potentially interesting character), but as an Asian American male who has wanted an Assassin's Creed game in Japan for a long time... I did feel disappointed.   \\n  \\nI'm not sure if my feelings mean I'm a terrible person though. The talk around it does sure make it seem that way. || [deleted] || Search out some more niche/smaller subs otherwise. Those are usually the best experience on here. || Wow a proper hardman, I bet you're a real tough cookie || The fact I haven't deleted the post ehhh, I just stepped on a landmine. You sound ironic though || Ikr...like a lot...which has more detailed history unlike Yasuke || Maybe you finally get to play as the Templar side in this one too? I dunno || Rather than using a Japanese man for their newest AC game, they took a historical black man - Yasuke, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga - and exaggerated the history to make him a samurai. You know, as the Assassin\\u2019s Creed games do, exaggerating things.\\n\\nHowever, there\\u2019s also Japanese *female* Ninja, but everyone is ignoring that because \\u201cgamers\\u201d are upset they don\\u2019t get to play as an authentic Japanese *man*, so the game must clearly be woke. || Ah, forgot to write the title...I guess it's reasonable since the topic still hot\\n\\nThe last ubisoft game I played was far cry 5 lmao. || https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke || Going real mask off there. || You know...this is the first time in the history of AC that one of the playable characters was actually a real person. The fact that he is obscure makes it easier to bend the historical facts a bit in favor of an interesting take on the period being portrayed. || From the trailer, this is spot on. He's very much being seen and she is not. || >Naoe the shinobi\\n\\nKunoichi. There's a term for female shinobi, even though a multi million dollar company seems to not be able to Google that for a second. || So they go a similar way like AC syndicate || LL cool jay in ncis la is the most covert agent. || Yeah it makes a lot of sense and should be a fine narrative. || This is the argument I'm making for it too. There's very little about him except that he existed and maybe fought along side Oda Nobunaga's son at one point. Exploring possibilities isn't ruining the historical accuracy of the character. People argue for historical accuracy saying he wasn't samurai, but since when did Ezio Auditore exist at all for AC2 to be accurate? Since when did Native Americans help Paul Revere? || Why? He learned to speak Japanese so he is speaking the same language as everyone else in the game. || No it isn't because we don't know where Yasuke came from in real life. There is a lot of details we don't know about him. || Makes no sense, we know enough...he existed, he lived in japan as a retainer to Oda Nobunaga and maybe fought along side Oda's son at one point. Beyond that they are free to explore fictional possibilities just like they did with every Assassin's Creed protagonist. || no it's not || I don't hate ubisoft, I loved many of their past games but those glory days are long behind them.\\n\\nThis comment of yours is also incredibly flippant and ignorant but whatever, its a gaming post. || No your not terrible, people are just insane these days || lol the same reason why you commented your pointless comment. || Not in the slightest || A character with less detailed history is actually better for AC purposes. || That\\u2019s the point?\\n\\n\\nLook at every main character for AC. They are deliberate because this stories aren\\u2019t detailed in history at all, in fact most of them are fictional. || Then all the people who watched the rage bait youtube videos come here and make the same dull arguments as the youtuber does. || I\\u2019m pretty certain Yasuke actually was made an honorary Samurai.  Or at least that twist is common enough it barely counts as a twist at this point. || \\\\*\\\"non japanese gamers\\\" are upset japanese gamers can't play a Japanese AC. || Can you please check the previous version of that article? || Mask off, white pointy hat on || From extra info given, he's a fighting based while she's stealth based. Kinda like sindycate. || She's probably called a shinobi because the word kunoichi wasn't a frequently used term in the edo period, and when it was used it meant woman in general. It was only popularized to refer to female shinobi in the 1960s by novelist Yamada Futaro. || You dropped your fedora m\\u2019sir || Real-life figures in AC are usually NPCs with story significance. You're not playing as Da Vinci in earlier games.\\n\\nIf Ubisoft wanted a Samurai for a combat focused character, the best choice would've been to make an original, native character, like Naoe is, and like nearly every other protagonist except Eivor. || Yasuke speaking is not an issue...but more on how will the conversation flow goes or how the in-game world react and adapt to his presence || Africa, he was little better than a slave, was considered as nobus clown more or less, || I read that he potentially fought at least one battle along side Oda's son. Still I think the possibilities of the storyline surrounding Oda's death and the feudal period and unification are interesting myself. || Could've been a fake but I swear I saw a historic picture of Yasuke's samurai armor. || How\\u2019s his comment racist? Just cause he wants an Asian guy as the main character? || I'm too fat for a fedora, thank you very much! || That argument doesn\\u2019t make it a bad character by default. Just admit you don\\u2019t like the black guy and get it over with.\\n\\nOne of the main arguments is \\u201cit\\u2019s not accurate he wasn\\u2019t a samurai\\u201d. My response is that none of the AC games are ever accurate anyway so it doesn\\u2019t matter, they are making it matter just because it\\u2019s a black character and they don\\u2019t like that part. || \\\"I'm a retainer for Oda Nobunaga\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh my bad lemme shut the fuck up\\\" || Just like it would regularly? \\n\\nThis is a non issue. || Dude are you seriously even making this argument?

I would do DS3 before Elden ring. DS3 is a better balanced and more linear experience. (I personally think it\\u2019s the best game ever made from a gameplay experience) and then do Elden ring (I\\u2019m in the minority that thinks it\\u2019s their 4th or 5th best title). The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous. My order of best to worst is probably DS3, bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Demon souls, Dark souls, Ds2 || i mean theres no need to to buy them at 60. if you play on pc they often go on sale. both ds3 and ds2sotfs go on 75% off and ds1 remastered goes on 50% off. next sale i would pick them up if you think youll like that style of game. || I used [this](https://www.fotor.com/features/collage) website || Well he likes fromsoft and bloodborne is their best game || I love all their final updates! They're so good. || The top 2 rows is telling me you were blue team all along lol. Hope you get one soon. || Get a ps5. The demons souls remake was worth it alone for me.

Do ubisoft writers like torturing themselves? PUT THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THE TITLE! || What are you talking about? What game? || No cause Hanzo is an important sengoku figure in japan, he should be a boss or mentor || I wonder how they gonna do the blend in with the crowd mechanic when Yasuke is the only tall and black guy around || IRL we actually know very little about Yasuke so \\\"bending\\\" his background isn't really an issue. || its curious to me that this its the first AC where one of the main charcaters isnt original created by ubisoft that later interacts with historical characters, on this one they just picked a historical character as one of the main characters. || I see this is more talked about than I thought on this sub so I'll copy/paste what I wrote in another post here. As an asian male I'm pretty disappointed that this game, set in feudal Japan, had an opportunity to feature an Asian male lead, similar to how they had other games in regions featuring leads descended from the country the game takes place in. Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. Not a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. To compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. If I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care. The best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin? Also that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received). How does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed. On top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused character. Naoe is stealth focused. On top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit. What's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much dude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. Usually it's best to give the game title in these little vague posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had: * Italian dude in Italy * English dude in America * Egyptians in Egypt * Greeks in Greece * Vikings in Norway, and England But they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones. None of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story. For a writer of historical fiction, it doesn't get better as using Yasuke. || Anyone is a better main character than him. They literally had the entirety of japanese history and they found the one black dude who was a footnote in their history and made him the protagonist so they didn't have to cast an Asian dude || Yes. Ubisoft is full on let's appease the masses and not get cancelled because we don't make decent games any more. || forced to play as someone you can't stand listening taking about virtues and righteousness knowing well those are lies anyone who kills with smile on their face like this is a psychopath. || No, he's a better character so it would stick even more when they raceswap him. || Yeah bro I was like umm is there a kill bill game I missed? || I miss the old rule of putting the game in brackets in the post title. || Assassin's Creed Shadows || Maybe as a villain probably like a rival shinobi clan hunting them. || He probably won't be able to, only Naoe the shinobi will do it. || It seems based on the trailer that it's Yasuke is combat focused and the other character is stealth focused. Not sure how that's going to play into the game. || He will definitely not be the stealth type playable character. || James Bond managed pretty well in that one movie right?...right? || I don't see this to be an issue when the blend in mechanic is kinda unrealistic in other ACs too. I mean you wear the craziest outfits so this wouldn't be a good way to hide anyway. || Thats actually what makes him a good contender for a playable character. || I'm concern how they gonna adapt Yasuke into the environment with the dialogue as well. || The issue is that he has the wrong background. || Wasn't Ad\\u00e9wal\\u00e9 loosely based on Black Caesar? || The opinion that should have been considered in the dev rooms. || The game you want is called Ghost of Tsushima and came out some time ago. This entire comment of yours reads like \\\"I hate ubisoft\\\" and that's fine, but don't hide behind fake outrage and victimhood. || I appreciate you. It's not a bad thing that they're running with Yasuke (he is a pretty cool and potentially interesting character), but as an Asian American male who has wanted an Assassin's Creed game in Japan for a long time... I did feel disappointed. I'm not sure if my feelings mean I'm a terrible person though. The talk around it does sure make it seem that way. || [deleted] || Search out some more niche/smaller subs otherwise. Those are usually the best experience on here. || Wow a proper hardman, I bet you're a real tough cookie || The fact I haven't deleted the post ehhh, I just stepped on a landmine. You sound ironic though || Ikr...like a lot...which has more detailed history unlike Yasuke || Maybe you finally get to play as the Templar side in this one too? I dunno || Rather than using a Japanese man for their newest AC game, they took a historical black man - Yasuke, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga - and exaggerated the history to make him a samurai. You know, as the Assassin\\u2019s Creed games do, exaggerating things. However, there\\u2019s also Japanese *female* Ninja, but everyone is ignoring that because \\u201cgamers\\u201d are upset they don\\u2019t get to play as an authentic Japanese *man*, so the game must clearly be woke. || Ah, forgot to write the title...I guess it's reasonable since the topic still hot The last ubisoft game I played was far cry 5 lmao. || https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke || Going real mask off there. || You know...this is the first time in the history of AC that one of the playable characters was actually a real person. The fact that he is obscure makes it easier to bend the historical facts a bit in favor of an interesting take on the period being portrayed. || From the trailer, this is spot on. He's very much being seen and she is not. || >Naoe the shinobi Kunoichi. There's a term for female shinobi, even though a multi million dollar company seems to not be able to Google that for a second. || So they go a similar way like AC syndicate || LL cool jay in ncis la is the most covert agent. || Yeah it makes a lot of sense and should be a fine narrative. || This is the argument I'm making for it too. There's very little about him except that he existed and maybe fought along side Oda Nobunaga's son at one point. Exploring possibilities isn't ruining the historical accuracy of the character. People argue for historical accuracy saying he wasn't samurai, but since when did Ezio Auditore exist at all for AC2 to be accurate? Since when did Native Americans help Paul Revere? || Why? He learned to speak Japanese so he is speaking the same language as everyone else in the game. || No it isn't because we don't know where Yasuke came from in real life. There is a lot of details we don't know about him. || Makes no sense, we know enough...he existed, he lived in japan as a retainer to Oda Nobunaga and maybe fought along side Oda's son at one point. Beyond that they are free to explore fictional possibilities just like they did with every Assassin's Creed protagonist. || no it's not || I don't hate ubisoft, I loved many of their past games but those glory days are long behind them. This comment of yours is also incredibly flippant and ignorant but whatever, its a gaming post. || No your not terrible, people are just insane these days || lol the same reason why you commented your pointless comment. || Not in the slightest || A character with less detailed history is actually better for AC purposes. || That\\u2019s the point? Look at every main character for AC. They are deliberate because this stories aren\\u2019t detailed in history at all, in fact most of them are fictional. || Then all the people who watched the rage bait youtube videos come here and make the same dull arguments as the youtuber does. || I\\u2019m pretty certain Yasuke actually was made an honorary Samurai. Or at least that twist is common enough it barely counts as a twist at this point. || \\\\*\\\"non japanese gamers\\\" are upset japanese gamers can't play a Japanese AC. || Can you please check the previous version of that article? || Mask off, white pointy hat on || From extra info given, he's a fighting based while she's stealth based. Kinda like sindycate. || She's probably called a shinobi because the word kunoichi wasn't a frequently used term in the edo period, and when it was used it meant woman in general. It was only popularized to refer to female shinobi in the 1960s by novelist Yamada Futaro. || You dropped your fedora m\\u2019sir || Real-life figures in AC are usually NPCs with story significance. You're not playing as Da Vinci in earlier games. If Ubisoft wanted a Samurai for a combat focused character, the best choice would've been to make an original, native character, like Naoe is, and like nearly every other protagonist except Eivor. || Yasuke speaking is not an issue...but more on how will the conversation flow goes or how the in-game world react and adapt to his presence || Africa, he was little better than a slave, was considered as nobus clown more or less, || I read that he potentially fought at least one battle along side Oda's son. Still I think the possibilities of the storyline surrounding Oda's death and the feudal period and unification are interesting myself. || Could've been a fake but I swear I saw a historic picture of Yasuke's samurai armor. || How\\u2019s his comment racist? Just cause he wants an Asian guy as the main character? || I'm too fat for a fedora, thank you very much! || That argument doesn\\u2019t make it a bad character by default. Just admit you don\\u2019t like the black guy and get it over with. One of the main arguments is \\u201cit\\u2019s not accurate he wasn\\u2019t a samurai\\u201d. My response is that none of the AC games are ever accurate anyway so it doesn\\u2019t matter, they are making it matter just because it\\u2019s a black character and they don\\u2019t like that part. || \\\"I'm a retainer for Oda Nobunaga\\\" \\\"Oh my bad lemme shut the fuck up\\\" || Just like it would regularly? This is a non issue. || Dude are you seriously even making this argument? He was a real person who lived in Japan. People knew about him as I'm sure he became famous in his own way being a retainer to Oda Nobunaga. || Nobunaga didn't consider him a clown. Don't just make stuff up that you don't actually know. We literally do not know his early life, where exactly he came from or even his real name. || The problem isn't that Yasuke is black, but why can't the AC game set in Japan have 2 Japanese protagonists? Nobody had a problem with Aveline in New Orleans, or Bayek in Egypt, or Connor in America, every other game had protagonists from the regions they were set in, this same problem comes up if AC went with Will Adams or Jan Joosten, the difference is Will Adams runs the risk of people saying Ubisoft is copying Nioh. || Would be funny like fallout dialogue options.

sale would pick think youll like style used website well like fromsoft bloodborne best love final update theyre good top row telling blue team along lol hope get soon get p demon soul remake wa worth alone pick returnal want another hard atmospheric misspeled sekiro man id put behind front sekiro rd best number\",\n          \"completed main story favourite far cry nfs mw broforce idk minecraft count killed ender dragon got elytron inspired start going list uh dont think ill room left dead goated great list aspire like eventually make realize despite gaming life actually havent beaten many

lol played quite year ago main issue got helicopter machine gun think became way easy plan cod wanted wa better yes far cry nfs mw broforce far cry\",\n          \"doe anyone think hattori hanzo better main character rather yasuke could like backstory least bend history without bending much unlike yasuke ubisoft writer like torturing put name title talking cause hanzo important sengoku figure japan bos mentor wonder gon na blend crowd mechanic yasuke tall black guy around irl actually know little yasuke bending background isnt really issue curious first main charcaters isnt original created ubisoft later interacts historical character picked historical character main character see talked thought sub ill copypaste wrote another post asian male im pretty disappointed set feudal japan opportunity feature asian male lead similar region featuring lead descended country take place altair arabic ezio italian connor native american etc etc ton representation asian male western im asking stuff asian male every nook cranny setting actually appropriate jin ghost tsushima prominent maybe ubisoft didnt want draw comparison fair guess part marketing cause talking compound matter added female asian character ninja rife even stereotype whatever point id surprised didnt wasnt positive wa gon na incredibly mediocre might care ubisoft gon na ubisoft dont care best historical playable character always creator wanting tell story guy know yasuke wa real samurai african origin also yasuke first playable character actually exist history black good point thought wa cool saw trailer asking japan since first came outand feature someone africai understand japanese would feel snubbed real world playable character real world character sidequest giving thats ha always change litmus test whether arguing bad faith would person outrageddefensive wa set zimbabwe black two main character minor historical figure happened asian man black woman btw go way plenty bad faith argument happening side pointless post even discussion going see fit within universe series random crap throughout history except unity syndicate comparatively le well received doe creedorder get japan yasuke came european thats potential angle transmission based tone video may come templar convert top generates interest unique seemingly absurd oh black samurai thats wild alright might need delete reddit bunch whiny cunt bringing boring conversation boring conversation regardless feel yusuke hanzo probably wouldnt good choice set syndicate stealth focused combat focused character naoe stealth focused top get freedom story either create character usually doe use someone vague history leave big name character meet would surprised hanzo going show sengoku period loaded interesting character yasuke yasuke wa actual retainer oda nobunaga black man japan stood nobunaga wa known advancement based merit whats odd naoes narration trailer sound like opposes unification put yasuke black without bending much dude every bended history like crazy idea youre talking mentioned ubisoft id suggest stay away usually best give title little vague post id say dont case far italian dude italy english dude america egyptian egypt greek greece viking norway england draw line japanese dude japan reason weird choice heavy racist undertone none matter good though personally skeptical considering shit ubisoft ha pulling recent year thing theyre pulling shit lol wonder world second aaaa would genuinely like see hattori kanzo ding ding ding contrary perfect character black actually existed make japan believable clear racial quota single stroke time barely actual information tell story writer historical fiction doesnt get better using yasuke anyone better main character literally entirety japanese history found black dude wa footnote history made protagonist didnt cast asian dude yes ubisoft full let appease mass get cancelled dont make decent forced someone cant stand listening taking virtue righteousness knowing well lie anyone kill smile face like psychopath better character would stick even raceswap yeah bro wa like umm kill bill missed miss old rule putting bracket post title maybe villain probably like rival shinobi clan hunting probably wont able naoe shinobi seems based trailer yasuke combat focused character stealth focused sure thats going definitely stealth type playable character james bond managed pretty well movie rightright dont see issue blend mechanic kinda unrealistic mean wear craziest outfit wouldnt good way hide anyway thats actually make good contender playable character im concern gon na adapt yasuke environment dialogue well issue ha wrong background wasnt ad\\u00e9wal\\u00e9 loosely based black caesar opinion considered dev room want called ghost tsushima came time ago entire comment read like hate ubisoft thats fine dont hide behind fake outrage victimhood appreciate bad thing theyre running yasuke pretty cool potentially interesting character asian american male ha wanted japan long time feel disappointed im sure feeling mean im terrible person though talk around doe sure make seem way deleted search nichesmaller sub otherwise usually best experience wow proper hardman bet youre real tough cookie fact havent deleted post ehhh stepped landmine sound ironic though ikrlike lotwhich ha detailed history unlike yasuke maybe finally get templar side dunno rather using japanese man newest took historical black man yasuke retainer oda nobunaga exaggerated history make samurai know exaggerating thing however also japanese female ninja everyone ignoring gamers upset dont get authentic japanese man must clearly woke ah forgot write titlei guess reasonable since topic still hot last ubisoft played wa far cry lmao going real mask knowthis first time history playable character wa actually real person fact obscure make easier bend historical fact bit favor interesting take period portrayed trailer spot much seen naoe shinobi kunoichi term female shinobi even though multi million dollar company seems able google second go similar way like syndicate cool jay ncis la covert agent yeah make lot sense fine narrative argument im making little except existed maybe fought along side oda nobunagas son point exploring possibility isnt ruining historical accuracy character argue historical accuracy saying wasnt samurai since ezio auditore exist accurate since native american help paul revere learned speak japanese speaking language everyone else isnt dont know yasuke came real life lot detail dont know make sense know enoughhe existed lived japan retainer oda nobunaga maybe fought along side odas son point beyond free explore fictional possibility like every protagonist dont hate ubisoft loved many past glory day long behind comment also incredibly flippant ignorant whatever gaming post terrible insane day lol reason commented pointless comment slightest character le detailed history actually better purpose thats point look every main character deliberate story arent detailed history fact fictional watched rage bait youtube video come make dull argument youtuber doe im pretty certain yasuke actually wa made honorary samurai least twist common enough barely count twist point non japanese gamers upset japanese gamers cant japanese please check previous version article mask white pointy hat extra info given fighting based shes stealth based kinda like sindycate shes probably called shinobi word kunoichi wasnt frequently used term edo period wa used meant woman general wa popularized refer female shinobi novelist yamada futaro dropped fedora msir reallife figure usually npc story significance youre playing da vinci earlier ubisoft wanted samurai combat focused character best choice wouldve make original native character like naoe like nearly every protagonist except eivor yasuke speaking issuebut conversation flow go ingame world react adapt presence africa wa little better slave wa considered nobus clown le read potentially fought least battle along side odas son still think possibility storyline surrounding odas death feudal period unification interesting couldve fake swear saw historic picture yasukes samurai armor hows comment racist cause want asian guy main character im fat fedora thank much argument doesnt make bad character default admit dont like black guy get main argument accurate wasnt samurai response none ever accurate anyway doesnt matter making matter black character dont like part im retainer oda nobunaga oh bad lem shut fuck like would regularly non issue dude seriously even making argument wa real person lived japan knew im sure became famous way retainer oda nobunaga nobunaga didnt consider clown dont make stuff dont actually know literally know early life exactly came even real name problem isnt yasuke black cant set japan japanese protagonist nobody problem aveline new orleans bayek egypt connor america every protagonist region set problem come went adam jan joosten difference adam run risk saying ubisoft copying nioh would funny like fallout dialogue option abuse oda nobunaga name rest ubishill promise feudal japan wa meeting ft black man reacting regular way guess since ubisofthopefully ingame conversation isnt forced fit yasuke narrative probably gon na expecting forced racism absolutely issue character yasuke wa adopted japanese culture nobunaga literally dont even know original name pretty lame argument already knew wouldnt different isnt bumpkin fresh boat retainer like based real person existed japan wasnt forced racism thing certainly happened feudal japan know exactly wa shill dont talk utter shit wa month got booted country wa novelty item best pet worst meeting many doesnt know stand like sore thumb name diversity inclusion funny asian men arent included word aint shill heck still major issue today japan still pretty well known unfriendly outsider societal level issue often isnt even acknowledged xenophobia issue country massively dominating culture thats often acknowledged local even realizing participate much like u unintentionally racist without true malicious intent fact life world level yeah call shill want info wrong may novelty wa trusted nobunaga obviously dont know wa think wa diversity inclusion lol stick like sour thumb real life keep saying diversity inclusion like yasuke real person character made pretty dipshit argument plenty asian men trailer well wrong anything act like total dipshit guess right fairly confident dont know meaning word shill either regurgitating dumb shit got slammed throat wow arent quite hater guy like came straight rage bait youtube video screeching like child diversity check box im dei pretty much anyone total l take harp character actually exist historical record little known take little creative license story havent even seen part yet already calling failure whole corpo bad

Is it good? || Was black flag really that good? I played the first 3 AC and didn't ever feel like trieng another one. But everyone always brings up Black flag. || Some Morrowind love, I like. I'm an Oblivion fan boy myself, but I can't deny that the games slowly started losing hard RPG mechanics and rep systems. Morrowind is like a blend of Daggerfall, and the systems that would become Oblivion. A very overlooked middle child, that weirdly has a ton of implications for the lore. || Dishonored was really fun || For sure pegged you as a zoomer then saw Elder Scrolls III\\n\\nNow I'm not so sure || Assuming you do not have a PS4/5? || Souls much? :) || Yes!

It's a fun twist on metroidvania || I see nothing wrong with this list, good taste, should try bloodborne, the thematic just beats all the other from games || Did we just become best friends!!?!! || Based on what I see here, I would recommend Hollo might like itw Knight. I think you || \\ud83d\\uddff || NPC normie gamer tier taste. || So a masochist you say || You into swords much? || Dishonoured 1 and 2, and nier?

I'd love to make one myself || Wow it's a good list not bad, honorable mentions for the Elder Scrolls , it's a relic. || I\\u2019m always surprised when I see people put Morrowind or Oblivion over Skyrim || Deadcells is such an underrated game. Hours of fun and grinding. || Dead cells kicked my ass.

Admittedly, a lot of my love for DS2 is due to my nostalgia of it being my first Souls game, but I enjoy replaying it more than DS1. || It\\u2019s like a blend of pinball and metroidvania genres. Well worth the time. Very unique || In my opinion Black Flag is goated.  It's my favorite in the AC series, and I've played all of them.  The story and setting are someone the best, and the ship combat is *chef's kiss.*  Also, pirates! || Black flag made me a pirate bro. || It's the best one || I don't, but I'm hoping to get one soon. There are so many Playstation exclusives I really want to play. || What is yours? || Elden ring 100% is, there\\u2019s an insane amount of content \\n\\nDS3 technically is too but I\\u2019d for sure try to get it on sale or from cdkeys or something || \\\"im just not sure they are worth 60\\u20ac\\\"\\n\\nall I would say is that even the DLCs From soft has made i.e. Artorias of the abyss , Ringed city & The Old hunters are better than a lot of full priced games\\n\\nElden ring main path alone will be close to 45-50 hrs & Dark souls 3 alongside its expansions will take over 100 hrs if you do everything , Elden ring will probably recieve DLC next year || They are some of the best fantasy games of all time. I would do DS3 before Elden ring. DS3 is a better balanced and more linear experience. (I personally think it\\u2019s the best game ever made from a gameplay experience) and then do Elden ring (I\\u2019m in the minority that thinks it\\u2019s their 4th or 5th best title). The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous. My order of best to worst is probably DS3, bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Demon souls, Dark souls, Ds2 || i mean theres no need to to buy them at 60. if you play on pc they often go on sale. both ds3 and ds2sotfs go on 75% off and ds1 remastered goes on 50% off. next sale i would pick them up if you think youll like that style of game. || I used [this](https://www.fotor.com/features/collage) website || Well he likes fromsoft and bloodborne is their best game || I love all their final updates! They're so good. || The top 2 rows is telling me you were blue team all along lol. Hope you get one soon. || Get a ps5. The demons souls remake was worth it alone for me. Pick up Returnal if you want another hard atmospheric game || You misspeled Sekiro my man || It's not. || I\\u2019d put it behind DS3 but in front of Sekiro || I did not || It is || 3rd best. || Number 1\",\n          \"These are all the games I have completed (not all of them are 100%, just main story) Favourites are Far Cry 3, NFS MW 2005 and Broforce. \\n\\n[idk if Minecraft counts I just killed ender dragon and got elytra.](https://preview.redd.it/vx2fqv5711yc1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95af34d2de9193389a5f42d6469b27c0c7aa0ce)\\n\\n This inspired me to start going through my own list, and uh, I don't think I'll have room here. || Left 4 Dead is goated.

PUT THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THE TITLE! || What are you talking about? What game? || No cause Hanzo is an important sengoku figure in japan, he should be a boss or mentor || I wonder how they gonna do the blend in with the crowd mechanic when Yasuke is the only tall and black guy around || IRL we actually know very little about Yasuke so \\\"bending\\\" his background isn't really an issue. || its curious to me that this its the first AC where one of the main charcaters isnt original created by ubisoft that later interacts with historical characters, on this one they just picked a historical character as one of the  main characters. || I see this is more talked about than I thought on this sub so I'll copy/paste what I wrote in another post here. \\n\\nAs an asian male I'm pretty disappointed that this game, set in feudal Japan, had an opportunity to feature an Asian male lead, similar to how they had other games in regions featuring leads descended from the country the game takes place in. Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. \\n\\nNot a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. \\n\\nTo compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. \\n\\nIf I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care.\\n\\n\\nThe best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin?\\n\\nAlso that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received).\\n\\nHow does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed.\\n\\nOn top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused\\u00a0character.\\u00a0Naoe is stealth focused.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nOn top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit.\\n\\nWhat's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much\\n\\ndude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. \\n\\nUsually it's best to give the game title in these little vague  posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had:\\n\\n* Italian dude in Italy\\n* English dude in America\\n* Egyptians in Egypt\\n* Greeks in Greece\\n* Vikings in Norway, and England\\n\\nBut they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones.\\n\\n  \\nNone of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story. For a writer of historical fiction, it doesn't get better as using Yasuke. || Anyone is a better main character than him. They literally had the entirety of japanese history and they found the one black dude who was a footnote in their history and made him the protagonist so they didn't have to cast an Asian dude || Yes. Ubisoft is full on let's appease the masses and not get cancelled because we don't make decent games any more. || forced to play as someone you can't stand listening taking about virtues and righteousness knowing well those are lies anyone who kills with smile on their face like this is a psychopath. || No, he's a better character so it would stick even more when they raceswap him. || Yeah bro I was like umm is there a kill bill game I missed? || I miss the old rule of putting the game in brackets in the post title. || Assassin's Creed Shadows || Maybe as a villain probably like a rival shinobi clan hunting them. || He probably won't be able to, only Naoe the shinobi will do it. || It seems based on the trailer that it's  Yasuke is combat focused and the other character is stealth focused. Not sure how that's going to play into the game. || He will definitely not be the stealth type playable character. || James Bond managed pretty well in that one movie right?...right? || I don't see this to be an issue when the blend in mechanic is kinda unrealistic in other ACs too. I mean you wear the craziest outfits so this wouldn't be a good way to hide anyway. || Thats actually what makes him a good  contender for a playable character. || I'm concern how they gonna adapt Yasuke into the environment with the dialogue as well. || The issue is that he has the wrong background. || Wasn't Ad\\u00e9wal\\u00e9 loosely based on Black Caesar? || The opinion that should have been considered in the dev rooms. || The game you want is called Ghost of Tsushima and came out some time ago. This entire comment of yours reads like \\\"I hate ubisoft\\\" and that's fine, but don't hide behind fake outrage and victimhood. || I appreciate you.   \\n  \\nIt's not a bad thing that they're running with Yasuke (he is a pretty cool and potentially interesting character), but as an Asian American male who has wanted an Assassin's Creed game in Japan for a long time... I did feel disappointed.   \\n  \\nI'm not sure if my feelings mean I'm a terrible person though. The talk around it does sure make it seem that way. || [deleted] || Search out some more niche/smaller subs otherwise. Those are usually the best experience on here. || Wow a proper hardman, I bet you're a real tough cookie || The fact I haven't deleted the post ehhh, I just stepped on a landmine. You sound ironic though || Ikr...like a lot...which has more detailed history unlike Yasuke || Maybe you finally get to play as the Templar side in this one too? I dunno || Rather than using a Japanese man for their newest AC game, they took a historical black man - Yasuke, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga - and exaggerated the history to make him a samurai. You know, as the Assassin\\u2019s Creed games do, exaggerating things.\\n\\nHowever, there\\u2019s also Japanese *female* Ninja, but everyone is ignoring that because \\u201cgamers\\u201d are upset they don\\u2019t get to play as an authentic Japanese *man*, so the game must clearly be woke. || Ah, forgot to write the title...I guess it's reasonable since the topic still hot\\n\\nThe last ubisoft game I played was far cry 5 lmao. || https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke || Going real mask off there. || You know...this is the first time in the history of AC that one of the playable characters was actually a real person.

There's very little about him except that he existed and maybe fought along side Oda Nobunaga's son at one point. Exploring possibilities isn't ruining the historical accuracy of the character. People argue for historical accuracy saying he wasn't samurai, but since when did Ezio Auditore exist at all for AC2 to be accurate? Since when did Native Americans help Paul Revere? || Why? He learned to speak Japanese so he is speaking the same language as everyone else in the game. || No it isn't because we don't know where Yasuke came from in real life. There is a lot of details we don't know about him. || Makes no sense, we know enough...he existed, he lived in japan as a retainer to Oda Nobunaga and maybe fought along side Oda's son at one point.

My response is that none of the AC games are ever accurate anyway so it doesn\\u2019t matter, they are making it matter just because it\\u2019s a black character and they don\\u2019t like that part. || \\\"I'm a retainer for Oda Nobunaga\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh my bad lemme shut the fuck up\\\" || Just like it would regularly? \\n\\nThis is a non issue. || Dude are you seriously even making this argument? He was a real person who lived in Japan. People knew about him as I'm sure he became famous in his own way being a retainer to Oda Nobunaga. || Nobunaga didn't consider him a clown. Don't just make stuff up that you don't actually know. \\n\\nWe literally do not know his early life, where exactly he came from or even his real name. || The problem isn't that Yasuke is black, but why can't the AC game set in Japan have 2 Japanese protagonists?

I can promise you that no one in Feudal Japan was meeting a 6ft5 black man and reacting to that in a \\\"regular way\\\". || I guess so since it's ubisoft....hopefully the in-game conversations isn't forced to fit for Yasuke narrative. \\nProbably gonna be expecting forced racism.. || People absolutely had issues with those characters. Yasuke was adopted into the Japanese culture by Nobunaga. We literally don't even know how original name. That is a pretty lame argument. || If they already knew him it wouldn't be any different. He isn't some bumpkin fresh off a boat here, he is a retainer. Like this is based on a real person that existed in Japan. || It wasn't forced, racism is a thing and it certainly happened in feudal Japan || I know exactly who he was, shill. And dont talk utter shit. He was there for 18 months, and then he got booted out of the country. He was a novelty item at best, a pet at worst. \\n\\nAnd this is an AC game, he will be meeting many people he doesnt know. And he stand out like a sore thumb, all in the name of \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\". Funny how Asian men arent included in those words, aint it, shill? || Heck. It\\u2019s still a major issue there today. Japan is still pretty well known for being very unfriendly to outsiders. It\\u2019s a societal level issue that often isn\\u2019t even acknowledged. Xenophobia is an issue in most countries with one massively dominating culture. One that\\u2019s often not acknowledged by the locals. Not even realizing they participate. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s much like people in the US that are unintentionally racist without true malicious intent. It\\u2019s just a fact of life in most of the world on some level. || Yeah you can call me a shill if you want but your info is just wrong. He may have been a novelty but he was trusted by Nobunaga. You obviously don't know who he was if you think he was out in for \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" lol.\\n\\nHe did stick out like a sour thumb in real life. You keep saying \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" but like Yasuke is a real person not a character made up for the game. That is a pretty dipshit argument. \\n\\nThere were plenty of Asian men in the trailer as well so you are wrong again. But anything you can do to act like a total dipshit I guess, right?\\n\\nI am fairly confident you don't know the meaning of the word shill either you are just regurgitating dumb shit you got slammed down your throat. || wow aren't quite the hater\\ud83d\\ude09 || guys like this came here straight from the rage bait youtube videos screeching like children about diversity check boxes. I'm as against DEI as pretty much anyone but it's a total L take to harp on this character because he actually did exist and is in historical records.

The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous.

As an asian male I'm pretty disappointed that this game, set in feudal Japan, had an opportunity to feature an Asian male lead, similar to how they had other games in regions featuring leads descended from the country the game takes place in. Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. Not a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. To compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. If I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care. The best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin? Also that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received). How does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed. On top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused character. Naoe is stealth focused. On top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit. What's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much dude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. Usually it's best to give the game title in these little vague posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had: * Italian dude in Italy * English dude in America * Egyptians in Egypt * Greeks in Greece * Vikings in Norway, and England But they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones. None of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story. For a writer of historical fiction, it doesn't get better as using Yasuke. || Anyone is a better main character than him. They literally had the entirety of japanese history and they found the one black dude who was a footnote in their history and made him the protagonist so they didn't have to cast an Asian dude || Yes. Ubisoft is full on let's appease the masses and not get cancelled because we don't make decent games any more. || forced to play as someone you can't stand listening taking about virtues and righteousness knowing well those are lies anyone who kills with smile on their face like this is a psychopath. || No, he's a better character so it would stick even more when they raceswap him. || Yeah bro I was like umm is there a kill bill game I missed? || I miss the old rule of putting the game in brackets in the post title. || Assassin's Creed Shadows || Maybe as a villain probably like a rival shinobi clan hunting them. || He probably won't be able to, only Naoe the shinobi will do it. || It seems based on the trailer that it's Yasuke is combat focused and the other character is stealth focused. Not sure how that's going to play into the game. || He will definitely not be the stealth type playable character. || James Bond managed pretty well in that one movie right?...right? || I don't see this to be an issue when the blend in mechanic is kinda unrealistic in other ACs too. I mean you wear the craziest outfits so this wouldn't be a good way to hide anyway. || Thats actually what makes him a good contender for a playable character. || I'm concern how they gonna adapt Yasuke into the environment with the dialogue as well. || The issue is that he has the wrong background. || Wasn't Ad\\u00e9wal\\u00e9 loosely based on Black Caesar? || The opinion that should have been considered in the dev rooms. || The game you want is called Ghost of Tsushima and came out some time ago. This entire comment of yours reads like \\\"I hate ubisoft\\\" and that's fine, but don't hide behind fake outrage and victimhood. || I appreciate you. It's not a bad thing that they're running with Yasuke (he is a pretty cool and potentially interesting character), but as an Asian American male who has wanted an Assassin's Creed game in Japan for a long time...

I can promise you that no one in Feudal Japan was meeting a 6ft5 black man and reacting to that in a \\\"regular way\\\". || I guess so since it's ubisoft....hopefully the in-game conversations isn't forced to fit for Yasuke narrative. Probably gonna be expecting forced racism.. || People absolutely had issues with those characters. Yasuke was adopted into the Japanese culture by Nobunaga. We literally don't even know how original name. That is a pretty lame argument. || If they already knew him it wouldn't be any different. He isn't some bumpkin fresh off a boat here, he is a retainer. Like this is based on a real person that existed in Japan. || It wasn't forced, racism is a thing and it certainly happened in feudal Japan || I know exactly who he was, shill. And dont talk utter shit. He was there for 18 months, and then he got booted out of the country. He was a novelty item at best, a pet at worst. And this is an AC game, he will be meeting many people he doesnt know. And he stand out like a sore thumb, all in the name of \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\". Funny how Asian men arent included in those words, aint it, shill? || Heck. It\\u2019s still a major issue there today. Japan is still pretty well known for being very unfriendly to outsiders. It\\u2019s a societal level issue that often isn\\u2019t even acknowledged. Xenophobia is an issue in most countries with one massively dominating culture. One that\\u2019s often not acknowledged by the locals. Not even realizing they participate. It\\u2019s much like people in the US that are unintentionally racist without true malicious intent. It\\u2019s just a fact of life in most of the world on some level. || Yeah you can call me a shill if you want but your info is just wrong. He may have been a novelty but he was trusted by Nobunaga. You obviously don't know who he was if you think he was out in for \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" lol. He did stick out like a sour thumb in real life. You keep saying \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" but like Yasuke is a real person not a character made up for the game. That is a pretty dipshit argument. There were plenty of Asian men in the trailer as well so you are wrong again. But anything you can do to act like a total dipshit I guess, right? I am fairly confident you don't know the meaning of the word shill either you are just regurgitating dumb shit you got slammed down your throat. || wow aren't quite the hater\\ud83d\\ude09 || guys like this came here straight from the rage bait youtube videos screeching like children about diversity check boxes. I'm as against DEI as pretty much anyone but it's a total L take to harp on this character because he actually did exist and is in historical records. Little is known so they can take a little creative license with the story. We haven't even seen any part of the game yet but some people are already calling it a failure. The whole \\\"Corpo bad, you are a bootlicker\\\" argument for every single thing is very tiring even for me.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

added female asian character ninja rife even stereotype whatever point id surprised didnt wasnt positive wa gon na incredibly mediocre might care ubisoft gon na ubisoft dont care best historical playable character always creator wanting tell story guy know yasuke wa real samurai african origin also yasuke first playable character actually exist history black good point thought wa cool saw

delete reddit bunch whiny cunt bringing boring conversation boring conversation regardless feel yusuke hanzo probably wouldnt good choice set syndicate stealth focused combat focused character naoe stealth focused top get freedom story either create character usually doe use someone vague history leave big name character meet would surprised hanzo going show sengoku period loaded interesting character yasuke yasuke wa actual retainer oda nobunaga black man japan stood nobunaga wa known advancement based merit whats odd naoes narration trailer sound like opposes unification put yasuke black without bending much dude every bended history like crazy idea youre talking mentioned ubisoft id suggest stay away usually best give title little vague post id say dont case far italian dude italy english dude america egyptian egypt greek greece viking norway england draw line japanese dude japan reason weird choice heavy racist undertone none matter good though personally skeptical considering shit ubisoft ha pulling recent year thing theyre pulling shit lol wonder world second aaaa would genuinely like see hattori kanzo ding ding ding contrary perfect character black actually existed make japan believable clear racial quota single stroke time barely actual information tell story writer historical fiction doesnt get better using yasuke anyone better main character literally entirety japanese history found black dude wa footnote history made protagonist didnt cast asian dude yes ubisoft full let appease mass get cancelled dont make decent forced someone cant stand listening taking virtue righteousness knowing well lie anyone kill smile face like psychopath better character would stick even raceswap yeah bro wa like umm kill bill missed miss old rule putting

nichesmaller sub otherwise usually best experience wow proper hardman bet youre real tough cookie fact havent deleted post ehhh stepped landmine sound ironic though ikrlike lotwhich ha detailed history unlike yasuke maybe finally get templar side dunno rather using japanese man newest took historical black man yasuke retainer oda nobunaga exaggerated history make samurai know exaggerating thing however also japanese female ninja everyone ignoring gamers upset dont get authentic japanese man must clearly woke ah forgot write titlei guess reasonable since topic still hot last ubisoft played wa far cry lmao going real mask knowthis first time history playable character wa actually real person fact obscure make easier bend historical fact bit favor interesting take period portrayed trailer spot much seen naoe shinobi kunoichi term female shinobi even though multi million dollar company seems able google second go similar way like syndicate cool jay ncis la covert agent yeah make lot sense fine narrative argument im making little except existed maybe fought along side oda nobunagas son point exploring possibility isnt ruining historical accuracy character argue historical accuracy saying wasnt samurai since ezio auditore exist accurate since native american help paul revere learned speak japanese speaking language everyone else isnt dont know yasuke came real life lot detail dont know make sense know enoughhe existed lived japan retainer oda nobunaga maybe fought along side odas son point beyond free explore fictional possibility like every protagonist dont hate ubisoft loved many past glory day long behind comment also incredibly flippant ignorant whatever gaming post terrible insane day lol reason commented pointless comment slightest character le detailed history actually better purpose thats point look every main character deliberate story arent detailed history fact fictional watched rage bait youtube video come make dull argument youtuber doe im pretty certain yasuke actually wa made honorary samurai least twist common enough barely count twist point non japanese gamers upset japanese gamers cant japanese please check previous version article mask white pointy hat extra info given fighting based shes stealth based kinda like sindycate shes probably called shinobi word kunoichi wasnt frequently used term edo period wa used meant woman general wa popularized refer female shinobi novelist yamada futaro dropped fedora msir reallife figure usually npc story significance youre playing da vinci earlier ubisoft wanted samurai combat focused character best choice wouldve make original native character like naoe like nearly every protagonist except eivor yasuke speaking issuebut conversation flow go ingame world react adapt presence africa wa little better slave wa considered nobus clown le read potentially fought least battle along side odas son still think possibility storyline surrounding odas death feudal period unification interesting couldve fake swear saw historic picture yasukes samurai armor hows comment racist cause want asian guy main character im fat fedora thank much argument doesnt make bad character default admit dont like black guy get main argument accurate wasnt samurai response none ever accurate anyway doesnt matter making matter black character dont like part im retainer oda nobunaga oh bad lem shut fuck like would regularly non issue dude seriously even making argument wa real person lived japan knew im sure became famous way retainer oda nobunaga nobunaga didnt consider clown dont make stuff dont actually know literally know early life exactly came even real name problem isnt yasuke black cant set japan japanese protagonist nobody problem aveline new orleans bayek egypt connor america every protagonist region set problem come went adam jan joosten difference adam run risk saying ubisoft copying nioh would funny like fallout dialogue option abuse oda nobunaga name rest ubishill promise feudal japan wa meeting ft black man reacting regular way guess since ubisofthopefully ingame conversation isnt forced fit yasuke narrative probably gon na expecting forced racism absolutely issue character yasuke wa adopted japanese culture nobunaga literally dont even know original name pretty lame argument already knew wouldnt different isnt bumpkin fresh boat retainer like based real person existed japan wasnt forced racism thing certainly happened feudal japan know exactly wa shill dont talk utter shit wa month got booted country wa novelty item best pet worst meeting many doesnt know stand like sore thumb name diversity inclusion funny asian men arent included word aint shill heck still major issue today japan still pretty well known unfriendly outsider societal level issue often isnt even acknowledged xenophobia issue country massively dominating culture thats often acknowledged local even realizing participate much like u unintentionally racist without true malicious intent fact life world level yeah call shill want info wrong may novelty wa trusted nobunaga obviously dont know wa think wa diversity inclusion lol stick like sour thumb real life keep saying diversity inclusion like yasuke real person character made pretty dipshit argument plenty asian men trailer well wrong anything act like total dipshit guess right fairly confident dont know meaning word shill either regurgitating dumb shit got slammed throat wow arent quite hater guy like came straight rage bait youtube video screeching like child diversity check box
