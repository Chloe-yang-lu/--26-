Is it good? || Was black flag really that good? I played the first 3 AC and didn't ever feel like trieng another one. But everyone always brings up Black flag. || Some Morrowind love, I like. I'm an Oblivion fan boy myself, but I can't deny that the games slowly started losing hard RPG mechanics and rep systems. Morrowind is like a blend of Daggerfall, and the systems that would become Oblivion. A very overlooked middle child, that weirdly has a ton of implications for the lore. || Dishonored was really fun || For sure pegged you as a zoomer then saw Elder Scrolls III\\n\\nNow I'm not so sure || Assuming you do not have a PS4/5? || Souls much? :) || Yes! Yoku\\u2019s Island Express representation! || I appreciate your bravery to exclude Dark Souls 1, and to include Dark Souls 2.

It's a fun twist on metroidvania || I see nothing wrong with this list, good taste, should try bloodborne, the thematic just beats all the other from games || Did we just become best friends!!?!! || Based on what I see here, I would recommend Hollo might like itw Knight. I think you || \\ud83d\\uddff || NPC normie gamer tier taste. || So a masochist you say || You into swords much? || Dishonoured 1 and 2, and nier? You are awesome. || I think you should give Hollow Knight a try || How do you make a list like this? I'd love to make one myself || Wow it's a good list not bad, honorable mentions for the Elder Scrolls , it's a relic. || I\\u2019m always surprised when I see people put Morrowind or Oblivion over Skyrim || Deadcells is such an underrated game. Hours of fun and grinding. || Dead cells kicked my ass. I wish I got to enjoy it more. || I like this one, especially for Dishonored / TF|2 / Dead Cells || AC 4 \\u2764\\ufe0f || Ever play breath of the wild? || Wow isnt this 90% of reddits favourite games || Dishonored series of games was sick bro\\u2026\\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffb || It's always interesting to me when people make lists like these, and I haven't played a single one of them || common xbox enjoyer || Not to mention the fifth final update is going to be out next year.\\n\\nEven after the devs have stopped supporting it, they're still supporting it.\\n\\nLegends || For some reason I don't enjoy it as much. Admittedly, a lot of my love for DS2 is due to my nostalgia of it being my first Souls game, but I enjoy replaying it more than DS1. || It\\u2019s like a blend of pinball and metroidvania genres. Well worth the time. Very unique || In my opinion Black Flag is goated.  It's my favorite in the AC series, and I've played all of them.  The story and setting are someone the best, and the ship combat is *chef's kiss.*  Also, pirates! || Black flag made me a pirate bro. || It's the best one || I don't, but I'm hoping to get one soon. There are so many Playstation exclusives I really want to play. || What is yours? || Elden ring 100% is, there\\u2019s an insane amount of content \\n\\nDS3 technically is too but I\\u2019d for sure try to get it on sale or from cdkeys or something || \\\"im just not sure they are worth 60\\u20ac\\\"\\n\\nall I would say is that even the DLCs From soft has made i.e. Artorias of the abyss , Ringed city & The Old hunters are better than a lot of full priced games\\n\\nElden ring main path alone will be close to 45-50 hrs & Dark souls 3 alongside its expansions will take over 100 hrs if you do everything , Elden ring will probably recieve DLC next year || They are some of the best fantasy games of all time. I would do DS3 before Elden ring. DS3 is a better balanced and more linear experience. (I personally think it\\u2019s the best game ever made from a gameplay experience) and then do Elden ring (I\\u2019m in the minority that thinks it\\u2019s their 4th or 5th best title). The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous. My order of best to worst is probably DS3, bloodborne, Sekiro, Elden Ring, Demon souls, Dark souls, Ds2 || i mean theres no need to to buy them at 60. if you play on pc they often go on sale. both ds3 and ds2sotfs go on 75% off and ds1 remastered goes on 50% off. next sale i would pick them up if you think youll like that style of game. || I used [this](https://www.fotor.com/features/collage) website || Well he likes fromsoft and bloodborne is their best game || I love all their final updates! They're so good. || The top 2 rows is telling me you were blue team all along lol. Hope you get one soon. || Get a ps5. The demons souls remake was worth it alone for me. Pick up Returnal if you want another hard atmospheric game || You misspeled Sekiro my man || It's not. || I\\u2019d put it behind DS3 but in front of Sekiro || I did not || It is || 3rd best. || Number 1\",\n          \"These are all the games I have completed (not all of them are 100%, just main story) Favourites are Far Cry 3, NFS MW 2005 and Broforce. \\n\\n[idk if Minecraft counts I just killed ender dragon and got elytra.](https://preview.redd.it/vx2fqv5711yc1.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95af34d2de9193389a5f42d6469b27c0c7aa0ce)\\n\\n This inspired me to start going through my own list, and uh, I don't think I'll have room here. || Left 4 Dead is goated.

PUT THE NAME OF THE GAME IN THE TITLE! || What are you talking about? What game? || No cause Hanzo is an important sengoku figure in japan, he should be a boss or mentor || I wonder how they gonna do the blend in with the crowd mechanic when Yasuke is the only tall and black guy around || IRL we actually know very little about Yasuke so \\\"bending\\\" his background isn't really an issue. || its curious to me that this its the first AC where one of the main charcaters isnt original created by ubisoft that later interacts with historical characters, on this one they just picked a historical character as one of the  main characters. || I see this is more talked about than I thought on this sub so I'll copy/paste what I wrote in another post here. \\n\\nAs an asian male I'm pretty disappointed that this game, set in feudal Japan, had an opportunity to feature an Asian male lead, similar to how they had other games in regions featuring leads descended from the country the game takes place in. Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. \\n\\nNot a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. \\n\\nTo compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. \\n\\nIf I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care.\\n\\n\\nThe best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin?\\n\\nAlso that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received).\\n\\nHow does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed.\\n\\nOn top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused\\u00a0character.\\u00a0Naoe is stealth focused.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nOn top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit.\\n\\nWhat's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much\\n\\ndude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. \\n\\nUsually it's best to give the game title in these little vague  posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had:\\n\\n* Italian dude in Italy\\n* English dude in America\\n* Egyptians in Egypt\\n* Greeks in Greece\\n* Vikings in Norway, and England\\n\\nBut they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones.\\n\\n  \\nNone of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story.

I dunno || Rather than using a Japanese man for their newest AC game, they took a historical black man - Yasuke, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga - and exaggerated the history to make him a samurai.

People argue for historical accuracy saying he wasn't samurai, but since when did Ezio Auditore exist at all for AC2 to be accurate? Since when did Native Americans help Paul Revere? || Why? He learned to speak Japanese so he is speaking the same language as everyone else in the game. || No it isn't because we don't know where Yasuke came from in real life. There is a lot of details we don't know about him. || Makes no sense, we know enough...he existed, he lived in japan as a retainer to Oda Nobunaga and maybe fought along side Oda's son at one point.

Kinda like sindycate. || She's probably called a shinobi because the word kunoichi wasn't a frequently used term in the edo period, and when it was used it meant woman in general. It was only popularized to refer to female shinobi in the 1960s by novelist Yamada Futaro. || You dropped your fedora m\\u2019sir || Real-life figures in AC are usually NPCs with story significance. You're not playing as Da Vinci in earlier games.\\n\\nIf Ubisoft wanted a Samurai for a combat focused character, the best choice would've been to make an original, native character, like Naoe is, and like nearly every other protagonist except Eivor. || Yasuke speaking is not an issue...but more on how will the conversation flow goes or how the in-game world react and adapt to his presence || Africa, he was little better than a slave, was considered as nobus clown more or less, || I read that he potentially fought at least one battle along side Oda's son. Still I think the possibilities of the storyline surrounding Oda's death and the feudal period and unification are interesting myself. || Could've been a fake but I swear I saw a historic picture of Yasuke's samurai armor. || How\\u2019s his comment racist? Just cause he wants an Asian guy as the main character? || I'm too fat for a fedora, thank you very much! || That argument doesn\\u2019t make it a bad character by default. Just admit you don\\u2019t like the black guy and get it over with.\\n\\nOne of the main arguments is \\u201cit\\u2019s not accurate he wasn\\u2019t a samurai\\u201d. My response is that none of the AC games are ever accurate anyway so it doesn\\u2019t matter, they are making it matter just because it\\u2019s a black character and they don\\u2019t like that part. || \\\"I'm a retainer for Oda Nobunaga\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh my bad lemme shut the fuck up\\\" || Just like it would regularly? \\n\\nThis is a non issue. || Dude are you seriously even making this argument? He was a real person who lived in Japan. People knew about him as I'm sure he became famous in his own way being a retainer to Oda Nobunaga. || Nobunaga didn't consider him a clown. Don't just make stuff up that you don't actually know. \\n\\nWe literally do not know his early life, where exactly he came from or even his real name. || The problem isn't that Yasuke is black, but why can't the AC game set in Japan have 2 Japanese protagonists? Nobody had a problem with Aveline in New Orleans, or Bayek in Egypt, or Connor in America, every other game had protagonists from the regions they were set in, this same problem comes up if AC went with Will Adams or Jan Joosten, the difference is Will Adams runs the risk of people saying Ubisoft is copying Nioh. || Would be funny like fallout dialogue options.\\n\\nJust abuse Oda Nobunaga name for the rest of the game || Are a ubishill???? I can promise you that no one in Feudal Japan was meeting a 6ft5 black man and reacting to that in a \\\"regular way\\\". || I guess so since it's ubisoft....hopefully the in-game conversations isn't forced to fit for Yasuke narrative. \\nProbably gonna be expecting forced racism.. || People absolutely had issues with those characters. Yasuke was adopted into the Japanese culture by Nobunaga. We literally don't even know how original name. That is a pretty lame argument. || If they already knew him it wouldn't be any different. He isn't some bumpkin fresh off a boat here, he is a retainer. Like this is based on a real person that existed in Japan. || It wasn't forced, racism is a thing and it certainly happened in feudal Japan || I know exactly who he was, shill. And dont talk utter shit. He was there for 18 months, and then he got booted out of the country. He was a novelty item at best, a pet at worst. \\n\\nAnd this is an AC game, he will be meeting many people he doesnt know. And he stand out like a sore thumb, all in the name of \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\". Funny how Asian men arent included in those words, aint it, shill? || Heck. It\\u2019s still a major issue there today. Japan is still pretty well known for being very unfriendly to outsiders. It\\u2019s a societal level issue that often isn\\u2019t even acknowledged. Xenophobia is an issue in most countries with one massively dominating culture. One that\\u2019s often not acknowledged by the locals. Not even realizing they participate. \\n\\nIt\\u2019s much like people in the US that are unintentionally racist without true malicious intent. It\\u2019s just a fact of life in most of the world on some level. || Yeah you can call me a shill if you want but your info is just wrong. He may have been a novelty but he was trusted by Nobunaga. You obviously don't know who he was if you think he was out in for \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" lol.\\n\\nHe did stick out like a sour thumb in real life. You keep saying \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" but like Yasuke is a real person not a character made up for the game. That is a pretty dipshit argument. \\n\\nThere were plenty of Asian men in the trailer as well so you are wrong again. But anything you can do to act like a total dipshit I guess, right?\\n\\nI am fairly confident you don't know the meaning of the word shill either you are just regurgitating dumb shit you got slammed down your throat. || wow aren't quite the hater\\ud83d\\ude09 || guys like this came here straight from the rage bait youtube videos screeching like children about diversity check boxes. I'm as against DEI as pretty much anyone but it's a total L take to harp on this character because he actually did exist and is in historical records. Little is known so they can take a little creative license with the story. We haven't even seen any part of the game yet but some people are already calling it a failure.

The issue with starting Elden ring first is that it goes completely against the direction of their other titles which were more linear and tighter experiences. Elden ring is gluttonous.

As an asian male I'm pretty disappointed that this game, set in feudal Japan, had an opportunity to feature an Asian male lead, similar to how they had other games in regions featuring leads descended from the country the game takes place in. Altair is Arabic. Ezio is Italian. Connor is native American. Etc etc. Not a ton of representation for Asian males in western games. I'm not asking to stuff asian males in every nook and cranny, just in settings where it's actually appropriate. Jin from Ghost of Tsushima is the most prominent and maybe ubisoft didn't want to draw comparisons. Fair, I guess this is all part of the marketing cause we're talking about it. To compound matters they added a female Asian character as a ninja, which is rife with even more stereotypes but whatever. At this point I'd be surprised if they didn't. If I wasn't so positive the game was gonna be incredibly mediocre I might care more. Ubisoft gonna Ubisoft. || I just don't care. The best historical playable character will always be the one the creators are wanting to tell a story about. || You guys do know Yasuke was a real samurai of African origin? Also that Yasuke will be the first AC playable character to actually exist in history.... || I am black and this is a very good point. I thought it was cool when I saw the trailer, but people have been asking for AC Japan since the first one came out..and it features someone from Africa...I understand why the Japanese would feel snubbed. || There should be no real world playable characters in an AC game. All real world characters should be side/quest giving. Thats how it has always been before. Why change it now? || Litmus test on whether people are arguing in bad faith. Would this same person be outraged/defensive if there was an AC set in Zimbabwe (which is 99.99% black) and the two main characters were a very minor historical figure who happened to be an Asian man and a Black woman. Btw this goes both ways, there's plenty of bad faith arguments happening on both sides. || This is a pointless post. Why is this even a discussion. || Going to have to see how it fits within the AC universe. It\\u2019s not a series just about random crap throughout history (except Unity and Syndicate which were comparatively less well received). How does the Creed/order get to Japan? Yasuke came with Europeans so that\\u2019s a potential angle of \\u201ctransmission.\\u201d Based on the tone of the video, he may have come with Templar and converts to the creed. On top of that, it generates interest on its own because it\\u2019s unique and seemingly absurd. \\u201cOh, a black samurai? That\\u2019s wild.\\u201d || Alright I might need to just delete Reddit. Just a bunch of whiny cunts bringing up boring conversation after boring conversation. || Regardless of how you feel about Yusuke, Hanzo probably wouldn't be a good choice. It is the same set up as Syndicate with a stealth focused and combat focused character. Naoe is stealth focused. On top of that you get more freedom with the story if you either create a character (what AC usually does) or use someone who is more vague in history and leave the big names for characters you meet. I would be surprised if Hanzo is not going to show up. || The Sengoku period is loaded with more interesting characters than Yasuke. || Yasuke was an actual retainer of Oda Nobunaga. Being a black man in Japan stood out, and Nobunaga was known for advancement based on merit. What's odd is that Naoe's narration in the trailer sounds like she opposes unification, which puts her against them. || Yasuke black || >without bending it too much dude every assassin's creed bended history like crazy || I have no idea what you're talking about but you mentioned Ubisoft so I'd suggest you just stay away from them. Usually it's best to give the game title in these little vague posts but I'd say dont in this case. || AC so far had: * Italian dude in Italy * English dude in America * Egyptians in Egypt * Greeks in Greece * Vikings in Norway, and England But they draw the line at a Japanese dude in Japan, for some reason. Which is a weird choice with heavy racist undertones. None of this will matter if the game is good, though. Which, I personally, am very skeptical about - considering the shit Ubisoft has been pulling in the recent years. The thing is, they're pulling the same shit again: [130\\u20ac for a game](https://store.ubisoft.com/eu/assassins-creed-shadows), lol. I wonder if this is the world's second AAAA game. || I would genuinely like to see a [Hattori Kanzo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Hattori-kun) game. Ding ding ding. || On the contrary, it's a perfect character for them. He's black and he actually existed, which makes having him in Japan in the 1500s believable and clears their racial quota in a single stroke, but at the same time there's barely any actual information about him so they can tell their own story.

It was only popularized to refer to female shinobi in the 1960s by novelist Yamada Futaro. || You dropped your fedora m\\u2019sir || Real-life figures in AC are usually NPCs with story significance. You're not playing as Da Vinci in earlier games. If Ubisoft wanted a Samurai for a combat focused character, the best choice would've been to make an original, native character, like Naoe is, and like nearly every other protagonist except Eivor. || Yasuke speaking is not an issue...but more on how will the conversation flow goes or how the in-game world react and adapt to his presence || Africa, he was little better than a slave, was considered as nobus clown more or less, || I read that he potentially fought at least one battle along side Oda's son. Still I think the possibilities of the storyline surrounding Oda's death and the feudal period and unification are interesting myself. || Could've been a fake but I swear I saw a historic picture of Yasuke's samurai armor. || How\\u2019s his comment racist? Just cause he wants an Asian guy as the main character? || I'm too fat for a fedora, thank you very much! || That argument doesn\\u2019t make it a bad character by default. Just admit you don\\u2019t like the black guy and get it over with. One of the main arguments is \\u201cit\\u2019s not accurate he wasn\\u2019t a samurai\\u201d. My response is that none of the AC games are ever accurate anyway so it doesn\\u2019t matter, they are making it matter just because it\\u2019s a black character and they don\\u2019t like that part. || \\\"I'm a retainer for Oda Nobunaga\\\" \\\"Oh my bad lemme shut the fuck up\\\" || Just like it would regularly? This is a non issue. || Dude are you seriously even making this argument? He was a real person who lived in Japan. People knew about him as I'm sure he became famous in his own way being a retainer to Oda Nobunaga. || Nobunaga didn't consider him a clown. Don't just make stuff up that you don't actually know. We literally do not know his early life, where exactly he came from or even his real name. || The problem isn't that Yasuke is black, but why can't the AC game set in Japan have 2 Japanese protagonists? Nobody had a problem with Aveline in New Orleans, or Bayek in Egypt, or Connor in America, every other game had protagonists from the regions they were set in, this same problem comes up if AC went with Will Adams or Jan Joosten, the difference is Will Adams runs the risk of people saying Ubisoft is copying Nioh. || Would be funny like fallout dialogue options. Just abuse Oda Nobunaga name for the rest of the game || Are a ubishill???? I can promise you that no one in Feudal Japan was meeting a 6ft5 black man and reacting to that in a \\\"regular way\\\". || I guess so since it's ubisoft....hopefully the in-game conversations isn't forced to fit for Yasuke narrative. Probably gonna be expecting forced racism.. || People absolutely had issues with those characters. Yasuke was adopted into the Japanese culture by Nobunaga. We literally don't even know how original name. That is a pretty lame argument. || If they already knew him it wouldn't be any different. He isn't some bumpkin fresh off a boat here, he is a retainer. Like this is based on a real person that existed in Japan. || It wasn't forced, racism is a thing and it certainly happened in feudal Japan || I know exactly who he was, shill. And dont talk utter shit. He was there for 18 months, and then he got booted out of the country. He was a novelty item at best, a pet at worst. And this is an AC game, he will be meeting many people he doesnt know. And he stand out like a sore thumb, all in the name of \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\". Funny how Asian men arent included in those words, aint it, shill? || Heck. It\\u2019s still a major issue there today. Japan is still pretty well known for being very unfriendly to outsiders. It\\u2019s a societal level issue that often isn\\u2019t even acknowledged. Xenophobia is an issue in most countries with one massively dominating culture. One that\\u2019s often not acknowledged by the locals. Not even realizing they participate. It\\u2019s much like people in the US that are unintentionally racist without true malicious intent. It\\u2019s just a fact of life in most of the world on some level. || Yeah you can call me a shill if you want but your info is just wrong. He may have been a novelty but he was trusted by Nobunaga. You obviously don't know who he was if you think he was out in for \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" lol. He did stick out like a sour thumb in real life. You keep saying \\\"diversity and inclusion\\\" but like Yasuke is a real person not a character made up for the game. That is a pretty dipshit argument. There were plenty of Asian men in the trailer as well so you are wrong again. But anything you can do to act like a total dipshit I guess, right? I am fairly confident you don't know the meaning of the word shill either you are just regurgitating dumb shit you got slammed down your throat. || wow aren't quite the hater\\ud83d\\ude09 || guys like this came here straight from the rage bait youtube videos screeching like children about diversity check boxes. I'm as against DEI as pretty much anyone but it's a total L take to harp on this character because he actually did exist and is in historical records. Little is known so they can take a little creative license with the story. We haven't even seen any part of the game yet but some people are already calling it a failure. The whole \\\"Corpo bad, you are a bootlicker\\\" argument for every single thing is very tiring even for me.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n

trailer spot much seen naoe shinobi kunoichi term female shinobi even though multi million dollar company seems able google second go similar way like syndicate cool jay ncis la covert agent yeah make lot sense fine narrative argument im making little except existed maybe fought along side oda nobunagas son point exploring possibility isnt ruining historical accuracy character argue historical accuracy saying wasnt samurai since ezio auditore exist accurate since native american help paul revere learned speak japanese speaking language everyone else isnt dont know yasuke came real life lot

ubisoft loved many past glory day long behind comment also incredibly flippant ignorant whatever gaming post terrible insane day lol reason commented pointless comment slightest character le detailed history actually better purpose thats point look every main character deliberate story arent detailed history fact fictional watched rage bait youtube video come make dull argument youtuber doe im pretty certain yasuke actually wa made honorary samurai least twist common enough barely count twist point non japanese gamers upset japanese gamers cant japanese please check previous version article mask white pointy hat extra info given fighting based shes stealth based kinda like sindycate shes probably called shinobi word kunoichi wasnt frequently used term edo period wa used meant woman general wa popularized refer female shinobi novelist yamada futaro dropped fedora msir reallife figure usually npc story significance youre playing da vinci earlier ubisoft wanted samurai combat focused character best choice wouldve make original native character like naoe like nearly every protagonist except eivor yasuke speaking issuebut conversation flow go ingame world react adapt presence africa wa little better slave wa considered nobus clown le read potentially fought least battle along side odas son still think possibility storyline surrounding odas death feudal period unification interesting couldve fake swear saw historic picture yasukes samurai armor hows comment racist cause want asian guy main character im fat fedora thank much argument doesnt make bad character default admit dont like black guy get main argument accurate wasnt samurai response none ever accurate anyway doesnt matter making matter black character dont like part im retainer oda nobunaga oh bad lem shut fuck like would regularly non issue dude seriously even making argument wa real person lived japan knew im sure became famous way retainer oda nobunaga nobunaga didnt consider clown dont make stuff dont actually know literally know early life exactly came even real name problem isnt yasuke black cant set japan japanese protagonist nobody problem aveline new orleans bayek egypt connor america every protagonist region set problem come went adam jan joosten difference adam run risk saying ubisoft copying nioh would funny like fallout dialogue option abuse oda nobunaga name rest ubishill promise feudal japan wa meeting ft black man reacting regular way guess since ubisofthopefully ingame conversation isnt forced fit yasuke narrative probably gon na expecting forced racism absolutely issue character yasuke wa adopted japanese culture nobunaga literally dont even know original name pretty lame argument already knew wouldnt different isnt bumpkin fresh boat retainer like based real person existed japan wasnt forced racism thing certainly happened feudal japan know exactly wa shill dont talk utter shit wa month got booted country wa novelty item best pet worst meeting many doesnt know stand like sore thumb name diversity inclusion funny asian men arent included word aint shill heck still major issue today japan still pretty well known unfriendly
