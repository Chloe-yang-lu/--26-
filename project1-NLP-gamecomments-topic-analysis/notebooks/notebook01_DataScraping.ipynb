Since its not ambiguous its straight up evil protag.\\n\\nMaybe fable. || You might try checking out the Mass Effect series. They are fun to play, and only \\\"gray\\\" if you make choices like that. Otherwise, no clue as games like skyrim and fallout to me were cut/dry good vs. Bad because of how I roleplay my characters. I don't like doing bad things as they make me feel bad, so I choose to do good. || Dragon Quest games are usually a standard good vs evil deal, very charming characters too || OP, perhaps it is time to touch some grass and get a reality lowdown. || Dude I think you should just stop playing games and find a new hobby cause this is just insane || [deleted] || Cannot see Kingdom Come Deliverance in your list.  Mad Max? But might be a bit too car oriented? || Have you considered Dead Space. Also your \\\"preferences\\\" are strict and stupid it removes most games. Also kid games are fun, have you played a Lego game while high or with someone who is, because it makes it way more fun || Touch grace op || Lol bro go touch grass. But the Fable series is great. Better than all the trash games you listed in OP || First, It\\u2019s called preference. It irked me that you people don\\u2019t realize that. Second, I only want well written good vs evil stories not cartoony cliche ones. Thirdly, I don\\u2019t like morally gray because I feel like they\\u2019re trying to make you sympathize or be relatable to horrible people like terrorists, serial killers etc. It doesn\\u2019t click with me and it\\u2019s disgusting. Which is why I extremely hate morally gray. Fourthly, linear games don\\u2019t have replayability and doesn\\u2019t allow you to play your own way. Finally, I\\u2019m not being difficult. You can\\u2019t force someone to like a type of storytelling or type of game they don\\u2019t like. I\\u2019m not saying you have to agree with me. I\\u2019m saying be respectful of someone\\u2019s preference and don\\u2019t accuse someone of being difficult because of that. Otherwise you\\u2019re going to come off as toxic, unhelpful, or rude. || Kotor 1 is fairly stock good vs evil, but Kotor 2 lives in shades of ambiguity || [removed] || Thanks. || It\\u2019s called preference. Also Stardew Valley doesn\\u2019t have a story, it\\u2019s a simulator, and a kids game. || I don\\u2019t have any games that I like currently. Reason being so because all the games I listed as morally gray is what I mostly played. || If he thinks Gerald of Rivia is \\u201cmoral ambiguous\\u201d then can\\u2019t imagine what he\\u2019ll think of Arthur. Which is tragic cause he\\u2019s missing out. || Assassin\\u2019s Creed has always been morally gray. Assassins and Templars only have ideas what\\u2019s best for humanity. Assassins want free will and Templars want Peace and Order. The only morally evil things in Assassin\\u2019s Creed is most Isu and the Instrument of the First Will. || You do realize I listed racing games as a type of game I\\u2019m not interested in. || I like games. I just don\\u2019t like games with a morally gray story and characters, linear games, and games with no story. I also prefer M-rated. I haven\\u2019t put Open World, Non-Linear, Immersive Sims, and Horror games on the list. || If you\\u2019re going to help me. If you\\u2019re going to be toxic with me for no apparent reason then leave. I\\u2019m not going to accept crap from people like you. || The morally gray that means lack of what\\u2019s right and what\\u2019s wrong. Unclear if someone is good and evil. Neither good or evil. Also that tries to make you be relatable or sympathize with evil people. Which I don\\u2019t like. I prefer playing as a morally good protagonist. || Hatred also not ambiguous Just evil || Alright thanks. || I haven\\u2019t tried Doom, so I can\\u2019t give you my thoughts. || Wow. You must be really uncomfortable with how life works... || Oh bless your little cotton socks! || Oooof, wrong on every count there my friend. It does have a story, but it\\u2019s an emergent one and it\\u2019s not just a farming game.\\n\\nAnd yes, I\\u2019m aware it\\u2019s called a preference. Stop being so defensive bud, that\\u2019s why other users are losing their temper with you. || What about Doom and the person who said the Arkham games. || Morally* || Geralt is morally ambigious lol. His whole spiel is about neutrality and tiptoeing the neutrality line || Ah shit I was trying to give sarcastic answers but now that I\\u2019m rereading the post they actually listed RDR2 || Templar want power and will do anything to attain that power and control people. \\n\\nThat,  to me,  is the root of all evil.  Power seeking and a lack of empathy.  Personal liberty and freedom is the only choice. || Well that seams to be the only thing suited lol that or strategy, but if you play that the wrong way that could moral ambiguous or gray too haha || Okay, but most if not all horror games are linear, meaning that would cancel out the whole genre. Open world games tend to be your version of morally ambiguous since you can choose your path to be good or evil. Are there certain games that put you off the entire genre? For example say you played  ride to hell: retribution and now you hate linear games. You mentioned you have no games you like right now. Are there games you liked previously? If so what are they? It may be easier to suggest with more info || I've come to the conclusion, after reading your responses in this post, that you yourself are fairly morally ambiguous which is probably where the problem  originates. || Oh to be an innocent child again life would be so simple \\ud83e\\udd23 || I\\u2019m not being defensive, I\\u2019m stating facts. || Assassin\\u2019s Creed Comuunity and other fans will say other wise. ||  Don\\u2019t play games with no story and I\\u2019m not a fan of turn based combat, || I don\\u2019t like linear games because they lack replayability and don\\u2019t allow you to go about a situation in your own way (not talking about choices). I have a problem with Elder Scrolls and Fallout because if you want to do a morally good or morally evil character. Either certain quests or the main story forces you to be morally gray which I dislike. Fallout: New Vegas is a good example of this. Assassin\\u2019s Creed I used to like but started realize it\\u2019s morally gray. || [removed] || All three things you stated by default, are opinions. Just because you believe them doesn\\u2019t make them facts. \\n\\nIf you want a more serious game that fits your criteria, you\\u2019re shit outta luck because I would suggest Horizon Zero Dawn but that\\u2019s not available on your console of choice. || Yea this is reddit, were all going to hell || And Forbidden West ruins Horizon with morally gray and the story being predictable unlike Zero Dawn. Yes, I played Zero Dawn when I had a PS4. || Well then, best of luck to you. You\\u2019re going to need it.\",\n          \"the metro series has hella amazing stories because they are based on books and have all of that content to draw from, as well as being extremely atmospheric || Have you played red dead redemption 2? || Ghost of Tshushima is really good || One game that has a cool storyline and still has a lot of multiplayer aspects is Neverwinter. the story line is good early game but tends to become a background towards the later game though. || I liked the Story SW Squadrons but thats just my opinion || The outer worlds was great. Huge worlds and amazing story || If you liked last of us have you tried the second one?  Really good don\\u2019t listen to the negative hype. Also days gone is another good one || Some call of duty\\u2019s have great story\\u2019s for example WWII or BO2 were some of my favourites || I found the AC series to have a great story. AC 1 is a a repetitive pain, but it\\u2019s worth pushing through. Then you can move on to AC 2 and all the entries up to AC 4. The rest is hit or miss but AC Origins and AC Odyssey are popular. || Subnautica and titanfall  have pretty good story lines || lego star wars iii the clone wars || Spec ops: the line I bought the game by accident and it still amazes to this day! It\\u2019s really worth a try. It\\u2019s a 3rd person shooter and the gameplay is somewhat like Cods you\\u2019re basically killing people. It has some extra gameplay features, but the thing that\\u2019ll hook you, is the story.\\n\\nMax payne\\nIf you don\\u2019t like old games (some people really can\\u2019t progress, makes them frustrated) play the 3rd max payne. It doesn\\u2019t get better than that! \\u201cTime moves forward, and nothing changes\\u201d\\n\\nAlan wake, Quantum Break, control\\nStory based linear games with AMAZING writing. \\n\\nWatch dogs 1\\nDon\\u2019t expect much, it\\u2019s an \\u201cinception\\u201d of plots. Story inside another, but still packs a punch! I liked Aiden much more than other protagonists in watch dogs series.\\n\\nMafia\\nWith the release of the remake, I strongly recommend that you play the 1st (remade version) and the 2nd one. Story, gameplay, everything is just perfect. Mafia 3 wasn\\u2019t that bad, if you\\u2019re using a pc I\\u2019d recommend just using cheat engine to pass the tedious missions and just do story missions. || Play Disco Elysium. It's an rpg, but has no combat system, so it's all choice and skill checks. It's also one of the best RPGs ever made. Like planescape level good || UNDERTALE || Great shout!! Will put it on my list. Just googled it and looks epic. || Yea loved it! The \\u201cending\\u201d was intense... || Looks intense!! || Ah nice, looks like Diablo? Or am I mistaken? || Was that good? I\\u2019m really thinking about getting it for PC to play 21:9 || This looks cool, does it have multiplayer? May save this and play it with a couple mates || Yea looks cool, will throw it on the pile for sure and give it a go, thanks! || That\\u2019s the Obsidian space rpg right? Idk if I\\u2019d call it huge. Borderlands is probably bigger than that short campaign. I enjoyed it but it felt short and forgettable || Yea I loved it! Fired up my PS4 from sitting in the cupboard for months since getting a PC just for this. I agree with you, negative hype was BS - was a great story and played with your emotions big time || Ha should of added them all there to my list as well; hammered through them too - but good shout. || Yea I agree, the Ezio story was perfect. Also love your username... wish the dude would finish the final book!! Assuming your name refers to name of the wind. || Yea I agree, I thought Titanfall was really good to be honest - especially multiplayer || This goes without saying - every Lego game is ace. I have played it (good one to play with family on Christmas break!) || Cheers, spec ops sounds like an interesting one!! || Looks pretty interesting; quite different style to what I usually play || It had me invested for sure || Somewhat like them. They were just clean 5 spoke wheels. || Its a really good game but If you only want to play the single player Its not worth it in my opinion also make sure to play with a controller || Yes Multiplayer is great but the learning curve is high \\n(Campaign does explain it very good tho) || [deleted] || on a side note, halo 1-3, odst, and reach are all great || I don\\u2019t want to oversell it to you but there\\u2019s a reason why whenever someone talk about \\u201cstory\\u201d in videogames I remember this game! || Is it quite a skilful game to play? Looks like you need to dodge a lot... I\\u2019m not known for my subtle plays \\ud83d\\ude02 || That the space pirate follower? || It has 4 difficulties and builds, I am sure you can find what suits you || You don't have to be subtle, only in a few story base missions like maybe 5 all together\",\n          \">At the beginning of the game, your world map will only contain region names. As you travel around, a radius of the map around the player will gradually be revealed. Viewpoints have been re-introduced, but they'll reveal less than in past entries of the series. These will be listed as undiscovered locations if the player hasn't visited the area prior.\\n\\nThis seems to be exactly the system that already exists, no? || We got to whip the map and GPS out like Far Cry 2? || I only play games with yellow paint to tell me where to climb || Ubisoft, the issue isn't the fucking icons themselves - it's the copy paste repetitive tasks that accompany those icons. || If it's like Odyssey, but with more costum made quests, less useless clutter and an reworked combat/stealth moveset...\\n\\nI would be very happy. || I'll wait until it is out for some time and have read reviews of reviewers I trust. Been burned too many times to just blow money out of the window.\\n\\nThis news, at least, reads like a \\\"yeah, sounds like a good idea\\\"-thing. || I have no issue with map markers and *you can turn them off* ffs || You could always turn off specific marker types in the menu? I don\\u2019t know why marker bloat is an issue in an AC game; you customize the map how you\\u2019d like. || For open world rpg style please just go back to how AC Odyssey was || Go full elden ring and not even show where the next quest objective is || As long as I can toggle specific icon types on and off. Mirage had that. || Really hope it doesn\\u2019t try to be like Elden ring tho. I don\\u2019t want to be lost and unsure what to do 90% of the time to pad out game time || Honestly I don\\u2019t mind if there wasn\\u2019t too much difference of activities. Taking down hideouts/outposts/forts, parkour puzzle, searching for treasure, etc is fine. I always just felt like there was way too much and makes each time less and less fun. I do like taking down a fort but taking down 20 is not fun. Less is more is fine. \\n\\nI do think they don\\u2019t need towers. Star Wars Outlaws doesn\\u2019t have any kind of tower system and you just drive around and find points of interest. Or you can buy \\u201cintel\\u201d from shops and they\\u2019ll point one thing out for you. It\\u2019s nice and lets you find stuff organically still or get small hints for things. \\n\\nStar Wars Outlaws should be the evolution of the AC map system. || it had also better cut down on forcing you to grind levels doing fetch quests to advance the main story. origins and the next two are straight trash compared to the og games. also sword sponging, never again you clowns || Icons are not the root problem, but a symptom. The issue is that the map is filled with repeated activities and pointless collectables in every direction. || FINALLY! That's what people have been waiting for! Not a game that works and is fun, without shitty microtransactions shoved down your throat at every turn, but a game with less map icons! Ubisoft is saved! || They've spent all this time removing extraneous icons? No wonder it took so long. || This game is still gonna suck ass || I still don't understand why they need to put any icons anywhere? Why can the player not just run into an npc? Why can't a player just run into a treasure chest while exploring? Devs need to stop being so afraid that players will miss some of the content they've made. Just have a little faith damn. \\n\\nIt just feels so much better to come across things on a map naturally. Not by running to a way point. || They are cutting down on profits as well. || And stupid playable characters that don\\u2019t make any sense? || The fact Ubi cannot let this game speak for itself should tell you everything you need to know about the quality therein. Feels like every other day some PR blurb comes out explaining basic gameplay systems in a reassuring light. || As if that\\u2019ll save the game || After the ezio games they fell off hard || But they won,t change my gender: still and forever non-buynary! || Do they still do the animus and future sequences? || I\\u2019m struggling to remember but thought the game, maybe odyssey or Valhalla, gave you an option to have less of these map markers or more?  What\\u2019s new here || I\\u2019ve payed a lot of these games and now I feel this map hiding scheme is annoying and makes me want to explore less. Just stop.  Open it up as the story progresses. || Did they confirmed a system akin to Avatar ? Would play it if it's in but probably skipping if there is nothing of the sort. || My issue with Valhalla was that they made finding and doing all the side activities and collectibles obtuse. I loved AC for chasing icons on the map and having fun climbing and combat. I dont want a hardcore exploration sim where missing a single line of dialogue means i can never complete my objective or where i have to search the side of a mountain for an hour looking for a cave entrance so i can get some loot. Just bring back guided mode like they had in AC:Odyssey and GR:Breakpoint so i can play with a damn podcast on and not waste all my time looking for a tiny ass key because they refuse to give me any information.\\n\\nWhile we\\u2019re at it, lets get rid of the dialogue options and focus on writing 1 good, compelling story, rather than 10 ok-ish stories filled with stilted voice acting. And please don\\u2019t bring back the mountains of .01% better loot that you have to stop and sift through for 20 minutes every hour and a half of gameplay.\\n\\nOrigins was perfect, imo. Had the best blend of classic AC and RPG elements. The next 2 went way too far into the RPG bullshit that just bogged down the experience. || Please less text on screen, too. Don\\u2019t need three quest updates, collectible counter, \\u201chelpful\\u201d hints, mini map, button prompts, daily challenge, special messages\\u2026 || Just like Star Wars Outlaws? || Devs who work on open world games are always afraid that players might miss sth they've worked on for 100s of hours, so by putting questions markers and % trackers they make these objectives feel like an obligation rather than something players would organically go and explore.\\n\\nMore devs need to follow the Red dead redemption 2 or Elden ring example and have confidence in the world they built, have confidence that players will enjoy it so much they will willingly wander around so they can find obscure secrets hidden within the map. || I want some more quality linear story games and less huge open worlds that either feel empty or full of meh. || Is that to go with their profit as well? || Will we be able to play a samurai ? || Damn, I hoped it wasn\\u2019t Farcry 3 all over again. I already played that game, I don\\u2019t need another one. || I mean it really can't get worse than the AC Unity map. || It also cut down on players || Sound like they are going to cut the game eventually || But if they do that then there will be no game left. || Who cares || Meaning it will waste even more of your time. || Yay no more checklists || Will they cut down on present day sequences? || I really like the way SW Outlaws handled the map, hope it is similar || Oh boy, more getting lost simulators, thanks Souls fans for fucking over the rest of us. || I'm not buying that one only because i'm tired of the same old Ubisoft formula. I feel like if you played one of them, you played all of them. || Incredible, will it also cut down on the mediocreness ubishit tends to release? || its basically assassins creed 2 for 10+ years how are people still playing them || Big issies of theirs has always been them clearly showing whwre every piece of content is on the map making the space inbetween feel empty and exploration non existent. || What the need to do is copy GOT game design and remove the level gates || Dear Ubisoft,\\n\\nPick up a copy of Horizon Forbidden West. Head to the settings and check out the HUD area. Click \\\"Customize\\\".\\n\\nSee all those options? Take notes. || Thank God. The next one might actually have less things to collect than banjo-kazooie did || Don't they normally have HUD options that let you turn these elements off anyway? || I hope we at least get proper quests and a quest log instead of that horrible world events system Valhalla had || They\\u2019re doing everything they can to make it seem like they haven\\u2019t made the same exact game for the 50th time || Lmao\\u00a0 || Will it cut down on bloat as well? || Literally all I want is a game that isn\\u2019t 100 hours, and is functional with a decent story. All I ask || Finally! Less cluttered maps will make exploration feel more immersive, bringing back the true Assassin's Creed vibe. Excited. || I really hope this game does well for them, it seems like they're putting so much effort into it || Doing this change this late is a recipe for disasters. They have come over relient on those to guide the player and I have no faith in their Level Design to be able to guide the player nearly enough. || This has been the case since far cry 3 radio tower climbing shit and they used the same fucking thing and same fucking playstyle for 13 years just because it was succesful once doesnt mean it will be forever they gotta stop making boring mediocre games to please stakeholders and insted listen to the community. || I'm not touching this without seeing some seriously positive reviews from independent reviewers. || I for one can\\u2019t wait to try this game out as internet YouTube \\u201coutrage for clicks\\u201d grifters don\\u2019t dictate what I like. Hopefully it\\u2019s not as boring as Vahalla which I couldn\\u2019t even finish || Map splat is the symptom of crappy maps, not the core of the issue. They can tinker round the edges, more information, less information. It won\\u2019t help the core problem of there being nothing to discover and the map design being beyond simplistic. || Im interested to see if this game manages to be better that Ghost of Tsushima in any way || Here's hoping they fiiiinally learned their lesson. It's literally their last chance to save Ubisoft.   \\nI'm liking what I'm seeing with the new movement mechanics. Really hoping they nail this one. || Bro, just continue the  Desmond/Ezio  storyline and go back to the stealth combat/parkour roots.\\n\\n  \\nprofit and save the effin company.\\n\\n  \\nalso, Black Flag was the last \\\"acceptable\\\" AC || fucking Upi love to dumb random shit all across the map like mad babysitter go and have fun || Ubisoft created the way to save the company from becoming bankrupt...deleting map icons. a small hint for the game designers. if the game is shit - making it harder won't help || A swing and a miss || I wish they'd cut down the game completely. Honestly Ubishit really just needs to go || [deleted] || Yeah\\u2026the game is still gonna bomb. || Ubisoft desperately need a W here, feels like they've been on a losing streak for so long || they say this everytime and its never been true once || I never get this criticism. Unity went overboard. Since then, it's been fine. I saw people gushing about Ghost of Tsushima about its mapcand lack of icons, it has more than AC brotherhood had.\\n\\nWhat games need to do is bring back minimaps for things like that. Oh this *area* is the shopping area, the minimal will show the exact location of shops. \\n\\nGhost of Tsushima & horizon forbidden west had me opening my map every 5 minutes. || There are still coming sequels? || So basically they CBF making more content? || The biggest problem with open world games is that the world exists to waste your time. The devs aren't given time to fill ot with anything interesting. Witcher 3 taught is this, with its bar setting side quests.\\n\\nThis game will be no different. Just a world full of low effort filler. || I want an Assassin's Creed where Im a native American, sneaking around in the desert, who slowly tries to take out the settlers killing the people and stealing land. Maybe a pet wolf for a companion. You use the eagle to scout and see through its vision.\\u00a0 || They can try cutting down the price of the game too. || You've played Ghost of Tsushima. Now play Ghost of Tsushima, but shitty! || Ghost of Tsushima's use of the environment to steer you is so much more immersive than \\\"mindlessly follow the icons\\\", and I have zero faith that Ubisoft can learn from it. || I havent played past Valhalla, but map was only revealed via dive towers.  Sounds like you can just naturally explore the map now and have it be properly revealed wherever you go.  Hopefully that means *less* collecting all the Ubisoft Towers and more organic exploration/gameplay. || Ubisoft are the masters at making the same game every year and twisting words to make it sound different. || People haven't played any of the recent ubisoft games that they bitch about for some reason || The idea of the full article is that the game will be less hand-holdy than previous ones with more emphasis on discovering things yourself instead of having viewpoints reveal whole chunks of map at once. || Same as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2. Question marks appearing (and saving) on the map only when you in some radius near them || I think they mean the viewpoints will work like they did in Shadow of War, wherein the POI\\u2019s become marked on the map by directing the camera in their direction. Instead of the typical synchronization points where many different POI\\u2019s were just automatically marked. || Not exactly. The question marks would normally be on the map before revealing, then would fill with what is at the location from using a viewpoint. This reveals that something is there, but you can\\u2019t tell what it is until you go there. Which honestly, sounds pretty good to me. A lot closer to what that scouting actually gives you in information rather than just knowing what a place is from a bird eye view a hundred miles away. || Just diffrent minigames probably xd || There were tons more viewpoints in the early games. I didn't mind that. Just don't make them all the same and tedious to climb like they were in Black Flag. || You would think || View points used to show you like every chest and activity in the area.\\n\\n\\\"Viewpoints have been re-introduced, but they'll reveal less than in past entries of the series\\\" \\n\\nIt's probably just gonna be vague about it now. || Sounds like it\\u2019s more akin to the way Breath of the Wild reveals the map now to me. I haven\\u2019t played an entry in the series since syndicate though so I don\\u2019t know how it works in the most recent games || Sounds like how Apple introduces supposedly new features that already exist in other phones. || kinda feels like the worksheet Witcher 3 system but with viewpoints || It\\u2019s the GoT system, the RPG AC games used viewpoints to reveal the map || Yes, but unity went a bit overboard, and AC3 was the start of it being a bit cluttered.\\n\\nBut like everyone that criticised assassin's creed it's something was fixed more than 10 years ago, but they couldn't be bothered to see if it was still like it or not.\\n\\nSeeFar Cry 6. Somehow its just another recycled heap of crapnwhere they never change anything, and at the same time the new superweapons and ammo type have changed the game too much and they should have stuck to their roots. || Exactly the same system, but *harder*. || Idk. It's kinda clear that this is just performative in the hopes people don't just go \\\"more ubisoft nonsense\\\" || [deleted] || I love how they just discovered fog of war and they're trying to pass it as an innovative feature. || I loved that mechanic honestly || First time i played through far cry 2 i ran out of meds right after falling out of the truck at the start of act 2 lmao. Good times || Or white paint ala Tomb Raider. || That I believe. || Thank you, this is what drives me crazy about this topic online. People act like if they just turn off all the map markers that'll make clearing 500 samey outposts more compelling. || Yeah, Elden Ring was so much better with its copy pasted smaller dungeons and reused bosses. Fighting the Erdtree Avatar for the fourth time feels so rewarding! || Isn't it the same in the witcher 3 ? Go to place, find monster, kill monster || ...Yeah the exploration mode or w/e the hell it was called in Valhalla didn't improve the game any. The locations were still boring and the activities the same. Finding an uninspired cache of crap 100 times is the problem not the map. In fact scouring for the uninspired stuff somehow feels even worse a lot of the time. || Exactly ! || I thought it was just a joke in my head, but this company might truly rather go bankrupt then change their decade old gameplay loop || We've been sitting on benches eavesdropping on conversations since 2007, more of that aint it. || Well sure but map markers are also a big problem in open world games. The map becomes all powerful and you end up spending the game staring at a little map in the corner. More stuff should be integrated into the game world. || Did you like odyssey more than origins? I thought origins was the best new one and every iteration after has been a regression. || they also hopefully got rid of the highlights around your character / enemies when you are in stealth mode or engaging them. it made everything feel so cartoony || [deleted] || this just means they\\u2019re putting less content in the game \\ud83d\\ude02 || Jokes aside the open world ac games do have a option to play with a more immersive map, meaning quest markers won't tell you exactly where your quest is, only the directions like \\\"west of X city, south of a lake\\\" and then you have to use the eagle to find the quest marker once you are close enough. is how i played the three of them. || Elden ring quest is easily the worst aspect of the game. || I see you've never played Morrowind.\\n\\n\\\"I need you to kill some bandits in a cave. They're somewhere south of Sadrith Mora. Go west from the boat dock until you see a rock shaped like a Kwama. Turn slightly south when the path turns north and climb over the ridge. If you've reached the water you've gone too far. Some ways past that you will find a shrine. Keep going until you find Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins, the cave should be near the third fallen tower.\\\" || You can actually do that already as an optional setting in Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. || I enjoyed Elden Ring a lot but I despised the fact I had to look at walkthroughs to see how to continue an intriguing questline. If the rest of the game wasn\\u2019t so good I wouldn\\u2019t have bothered and just stopped playing. || I wouldn\\u2019t mind that if progressing the story didn\\u2019t lock you out of whole quest chains. || In Bloodborne any hints about the game basics you get only after you die and you have to fucking pick them up from the ground and read. || Because they made a giant empty map with a small handful of copy pasted events you\\u2019d never even bump into if they didn\\u2019t outright force it with absolutely no effort put into making things discoverable without them. But hey, now they made the icons require you to wander aimlessly more I\\u2019m sure that will be just as good as making an interesting map! || Yes, but theres alot less of it || Until you realise that you are still just revealing multiples of the same thing throughout the entire map.\\n\\nIt's the same formula, the same mechanic, just not revealed to the player in the same way.\\n\\nAs old and sometimes annoying as the cluttered map thing is, it doesn't really bother me when all is said and done.  If the game is fun to play and can keep me interested I'll enjoy it regardless.\\n\\nWith any luck players can also apply filters to display only what they want, or nothing at all.  I'd probably prefer to just filter the map to display nothing at all in an attempt to up the immersion to a maximum.  Maybe only display major settlements/ villages and castle towns etc.\\n\\nIt is promising to hear that they've taken a slightly different approach though I guess.  Just got to wait and see how that actually translates into the actual game with regards to exploration and the all too familiar viewpoints. || Wdym? This has been planned since the start. One of the goals of shadows was to improve the open world and make it more dynamic || Maybe the idea is that you'll keep finding *something*, not something specific. That's part of the appeal of open-world games. || I kind of liked the playful jab at this in Far Cry 5 where you watch the John seed video || I\\u2019m sure Ubisoft can buy plenty of those. || I'm expecting that in some. I think map is given, GoT is quite empty and shadows will have big cities and a lot of npcs. Maybe side quests, most AC games have better generic side quests than GoT which was just the same kill mongols/bandits repeated. Collectibles is a bit questionable, but at least it won't have 49 fox dens. Main story can be, I don't really like GoT's generic honorable samurai trope, but who knows. Where I don't think shadows will match GoT is combat for sure. || tsushima, not a chance, wokeshima, maybe || I hope they will but I doubt it. From what I\\u2019ve seen from gameplay snippets, it looks like they pasted Valhalla and Odyssey again with a handful of new animations. || Valhalla made over a billion the current way sells no matter how much reddit wants to keep saying its the same game || Ubisoft has had time saver packs that revealed locations as early as Black Flag (AC 4). || Am I the only one who finds these \\\"eagles as drones\\\" unbearably ridiculous? || That\\u2019s how it worked in AC III (and maybe the earlier ones?). Walking at ground level revealed a small area around you on the world map. Traveling on rooftops and higher elevations would reveal a wider radius around you, and the viewpoints revealed a very large radius around them.\\n\\nI remember in AC III, you had to uncover like 95% of the world map to fulfill the criteria to 100% the game, which required a good bit of exploration across parts of the frontier map that had no convenient viewpoints.\\n\\nI think around Unity they dropped that idea and districts were completely visible when you unlock or cross into them for the first time. || The way it's described makes me worry they're just going to have icons not show up until you get near, but that's only part of the issue with the ubisoft open world \\\"map checklist of boring side quests\\\" games. It still needs to feel like you're finding something in the world and not finding a glowing mini-game start promp that poops money at you for jumping on shit for no reason. || I'm not sure about how organic that alternative really is \\ud83d\\ude05 || They already made it so you could turn off the guided experience and play exactly as you described. They did the same in several other of their franchises as well. || This sounds similar to Ghost Recon Breakpoint's exploration system. Things appear on your minimap within a certain radius as an undiscovered location, and only show up on the map if either you gained some info revealing that location (by interrogating someone or something), or if you visit it yourself. I still think that game reveals too much info to the player, but it's a far cry better than it could be. || Might be closer to modern gaming, but it strips yet another part of the Assassin\\u2019s Creed identity. Assassin\\u2019s Towers were required because you would often be lost with the blurred minimap in the labyrinths that were the cities from the Ezio trilogy.  You lost this a bit with the more open-world III and Black Flag, but Unity brought it back and I always saw this as one of the integral parts of the AC experience. The view points are your first pitstop in any new area.\\n\\nYet, this is one of the many, many identities of the franchise that Ubisoft is stripping, so who the fuck cares? || I honestly wouldn't mind if the game play didn't change much if the stories were good. I recently replayed the Ezio trilogy and had a blast. Then I played AC3. They not only completely changed the gameplay, which I didn't like, but there was absolutely so story to speak of. || They did not write the article || I just wish they made another Rayman \\ud83d\\ude14 || I remember when they said Valhalla would be a little more focused than Odyssey, with less busywork. \\ud83e\\udd72 || Let's not pretend that gamers have problem with that, it's mostly sentiment just because it's Ubisoft, they would buy same slop from other studios || Don't have to if you played Far Cry 3. The basic gameplay loop is pretty much the same clear the outpost 50 times nonsense || Same system as Star Wars Outlaws. Question marks on your compass when you\\u2019re exploring, and other markers appearing when you get clues from\\nTalking to random NPCs. || No you didn\\u2019t? || Explaining \\u2260 them acting like they\\u2019re inventing it || Yeah it was awesome. Almost the entire industry (including Ubisoft) moved the opposite way by gamifying everything in the following decade. Far Cry 2 specifically went kinda nuts with wind simulation that affected fire propagation and that map. They even showed off vegetation regrowth in a demo, and I think some form of it made it in, but the stuff they were showing off was super cool.\\n\\nFar Cry 3 was great too, but it kinda sucks that the success of it stuck Ubisoft in that direction.\\n\\nNot to say every game needs a physical map, but in open-world games, the more a studio can do to bring the player closer to the character/remove unnecessary menu flipping, the better. UI elements and the map are an easy win IMO.\\n\\nIt's kinda wild to me that it took as long as it did for a game like Ghost of Tsushima to come out. The side activities are really not that much different from an AC game, they are just presented much more naturally (obviously the game has a ton of its own merits - it's great, but just the presentation of side activities alone was a breath of fresh air for people). || Or kill this corrupt evil \\u2026 whatever he is, who also happens to be a Templar. The lore framework is an epic conspiracy ideological struggle that spans millenniums, yet the best they can do for side quests are filler mustache twirling comical villains || I don't think anyone tired of same-y copypasted shit in open worlds is praising that part of Elden Ring or BOTW/TOTK or whatever.\\n\\nIt's not great anywhere. || [deleted] || Yup, most open world games tend to have this copy pasted issue like how Witcher 3 had repeated bandit camps, monster nests, guarded chest or how Ghost of Tsushima had the fox shrine and mongul camps. || Love that Elden Ring wastes my time by not showing Ive already killed a dungeon boss so I get to the boss arena only for it to be empty. || It is, but it at least has really, *really* good writing to back it up. Something Ubisoft solely lacks.\\n\\nThat said it also shares the same problems as Ubi games too, when people tell you that you can just disable so many UI elements, or enable an \\\"exploration mode\\\". Which is the fact that quests were designed *with* the markers in mind, and I have stumbled upon quests in Witcher 3 that don't give you any information beyond \\\"My friend's missing, can you find him?\\\" - guess what's the *only* thing that can point you towards the destination? || Sure if you're doing witcher contracts and literally nothing else. || All stories boil down to \\\"go to place, do thing\\\". \\n\\nIt's a writer's job to create a narrative that illudes the player enough to turn a \\\"Quest added: go and kill 5 wolves\\\" into an epic tale. || well that's just one game that released almost 10 years ago. ubisoft keeps releasing an inferior witcher 3 like every 2 years || The witcher sucks for me, tried 3 times but quit every time, love the new AC games but from what I've seen the witcher is the superior game story and dialogue wise, finished cp 2077 and it's the same, just superior story telling, you want to do everything bcs it is interesting, you don't just go somewhere to do something for a reword or to grind levels, you follow an interesting narative. I love AC bcs of history but damn do I cringe at some questionable narative and dialogue options || Personally liked Odyssey more, liked Cassandra a lot and really wanted to kill my brother lmao\\n\\nI also prefer the setting more, liked the ship system as well || I just got odyssey last month. I was debating between that and origins, but I thought greek mythology was slightly more interesting. The last ac game i played before this one was ac 3. I loved it at first. But I'm getting a bit burnt out. It's very samey. I'm doingbtue same thing over and over again. And the map is way too big. I've not explored much of it and I'm not looking forward to exploring more. || Odyssey was my personal favorite in the Ancient Trilogy. Not just because it was made by the same subdivision of Ubisoft that made Black Flag (hence the familiar ship battles and the same hilarious stealth bush exploits), but I also enjoyed the response the game had to your actions. Helping factions gain territory, bit by bit. And it was one of the only Assassins Creed games that didn't say \\\"This ancestor did not kill civilians\\\". You'd just get a bounty instead.\\n\\nAnd Valhalla was my second favorite. Granted, the story *did* feel longer than it really should've been but I loved the atmosphere it had. I *am* with the others who say the whole \\\"Asgard questline\\\" was kinda redundant. Heck, I didn't really understand it. Especially when >!Basim just suddenly goes rabid on you at the end of the game. Where the heck did that come from, unless... Was he the \\\"descendant of Loki\\\" like Eivor was the \\\"descendant of Odin\\\"? I haven't played Mirage yet but the title alone reinforces my theory since Loki is the god of mischief and *illusions*.!<\\n\\nOrigins? Desert = difficult to manage atmosphere and it appeared to me that they dropped the ball on delivering atmosphere for that game anyways. Combat was feeling very lackluster and the story felt even more \\\"textbook cult villain\\\" than Odyssey's Cult of Kosmos. I barely made it past the first chapter and into the first big city before I had enough. || I liked origins a lot but I liked origins more. I'm probably biased though  because I'm alot more interested in ancient Greece than I am in ancient Egypt. || Frankly, picking a game in that trilogy is more of \\\"are you a vikings fan, a greek myth fan, or egypt fan?\\\"\\n\\nI hated AC origins' level gating. Giving you a questline but breaking progression to force you to do side quests because enemies really get tougher 3 levels above.\\n\\nPeople remarked that odyssey has worse level gating but i never noticed it because the setting engaged me to explore and do quests. Ya know, like you are in the odyssey sailing around, or fulfilling labors like Heracles.\\n\\nValhalla got me excited for vikings, but that one was just bloated af. Ironically, odyssey is also bloated but it wasn't problematic. At least the main quest was separated into 3 quest lines.\\n\\nThey're not all bad games. I own all three, but it can be argued that you could be satisfied owning just one\\u2014hence why you pick according to your preference of the setting. || Personally I preferred Odyssey. I thought the main character was more likeable, the world was prettier, and the gameplay was better. \\n\\nOrigins tried really hard to be Witcher 3. It was clear the developers wanted people to fight enemies in melee out in the open, and the hidden blade was only there because it was still technically an Assassin's Creed game. In its big skill tree with over 60 skills, only three affect assassinations, and they're just instant loot and a bit more XP. Also the hidden blade barely dealt any damage to bigger enemies.\\n\\nOdyssey meanwhile had an entire third of its skill tree dedicated to stealth gameplay and assassinations, and you could get gear that boosts stealth damage. || >Hiding it all doesn't fix the problem of their game worlds being boring.\\n\\nAC Valhalla was the only one I found \\\"boring\\\"\\n\\nBut that was also 9th century England, so? || Only FromSoft could get away with such a terrible (nonexistent) quest system. Any other company would get demolished. || It's unfortunate. I love the idea of it, everything feels so mysterious and there is no hand holding, you really have to figure it out all on your own and it wouldn't feel like a from soft game any other way. But of course, eventually, you just end up looking it all up. Even the NPC markers they added later were an afterthought that it seemed like they didn't want to include, but were pressured to compromise, since they were trying to appeal to a much wider audience. || Somehow they managed to double down on it for the DLC too, since some of the side quests permanently break if you walk to the wrong spot before completing certain parts of them. At least in the base game you had to do obviously major things like kill gods to break the quests. Now its just oops walked across the wrong bridge. Bye bye quest. || A note system would go a long way. || >Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins\\n\\nNot to be confused with the Sepharahapharahada Dwemer ruins || I really miss this. || You make it out as a bad thing but I love Morrowind's immersive way of providing directions and I think many others feel the same. It's better than Elden Ring's way of doing it, which is not telling you at all where you can expect to encounter this character again next time, which is a requirement to advance the quest. || That's still way easier than Elden Ring. In that example even if you wander around a bit once you find that Dwemer ruin you at least know you're close just look for a cave opening near it. || Doesn\\u2019t Morrowind at least have a diary system? || \\u201cWe changed the map like six times after this description was written. Good luck.\\u201d || >\\\"I need you to kill some bandits in a cave. They're somewhere south of Sadrith Mora. ~~Go west from the boat dock until you see a rock shaped like a Kwama. Turn slightly south when the path turns north and climb over the ridge. If you've reached the water you've gone too far. Some ways past that you will find a shrine. Keep going until you find Ashisniskahsina Dwemer ruins, the cave should be near the third fallen tower.~~\\\"\\n\\nThat's how about how much info the player is given in the average elden ring quest. || That would be so much better than what Elden Ring does. || >With any luck players can also apply filters to display only what they want, or nothing at all.  I'd probably prefer to just filter the map to display nothing at all in an attempt to up the immersion to a maximum.  Maybe only display major settlements/ villages and castle towns etc.\\n\\nControlling how many map markers were available was already possible in the last games to some extent. || Yeah, I much prefer the checklist-like style of Ubisoft open worlds, to the lies that their \\\"exploration modes\\\" try to tell me.\\n\\nWhen you tell and show me that it's a checklist, I know what I'm getting into. And that's fine, sometimes I crave this simple, but entertaining enough game design.\\n\\nBut when you proudly display \\\"EXPLORATION MODE\\\" in the settings and marketing, that's what I expect. A mode that will let me explore the world, instead of going from one map marker to another, just in a slightly more tedious way. Because that's exactly what I found these modes to be, instead of \\\"Your target is in village X\\\", it says \\\"Your target is southwest of place X, surrounded by some hills and with a little campsite in the middle\\\". So you just look at your map and place a marker vaguely where you think this is and... Go there.\\n\\nOr follow the compass instead, which is basically the same thing. All this adds, is another step to end up with the same result and I really didn't like it. It wasn't different enough to warrant adding this step, nor was it difficult. || From the gameplay we've seen the game is littered in icones. || And that's why I listen to their reasoning and not just if they say it's good or not. || we have more game players now than ever, sales numbers mean very little since the early 2000's\\n\\n  \\ni remember people saying \\\"vote with yoru wallet\\\" before then and it didnt work... || No. Thankfully the eagle is removed in AC shadows. || People haven't read the blogpost explaining it.\\n\\nEssentially they're just time-gating everything.  Those time-gates are now called \\\"scouts\\\" (lol).  So you send scouts out (never physically, it's just menuing) to do \\\"intelligence gathering\\\" (select scouts, select region) and after some time passes, the invisible meter fills up and they come back with a map marker.  Unless you stumble across the discovery first.\\n\\nSo it's not really solving map clutter, it's just delaying it so it doesn't look cluttered.\\n\\nWhich is exactly the kind of solution that people who make games but don't play games would come up with. || No, the earlier games only revealed areas through viewpoints. The later AC2 games also dropped maps for collectibles after a point for completionists.\\n\\nEven Ghost of Tsushima, which Shadows is clearly trying to ride the coattails of, included in game ways to find all collectibles. I highly doubt Shadows is going to be as kind because they want those engagement numbers. || > The way it's described makes me worry they're just going to have icons not show up until you get near\\n\\n\\nThat's how Ghost of Tsushima did it and I hear no complaints about that. || As someone who has actually very much enjoyed many of the recent open world Ubi games, my biggest issue is with how general discovery is managed. I tend to play these games without just checking icon objectives off the map/list. I do just go the open exploration route. But what I'll run into are locations that obviously look as if I should be able to activate or access something. But those locations require me to first trigger a regional side quest first. That all needs to be redesigned. Like, it either needs to be obvious that I shouldn't waste my time trying to make something happen that straight up can't happen without a quest being active, or they need to redesign these mechanics so they can be accessed in any order and any time. And if you encounter an NPC who triggers a quest, ant you have already completed it, then you can interact with them in a realistic and dynamic way that completes the quest in that instance (like delivering a special item). Or maybe quests can be triggered from two points? You can either talk to the NPC who tells you where about to find an item, or you find the item and it tells you where to deliver it. || It sounds like Shadows is going to be more \\\"open world\\\" like Black Flag/Valhalla, so IMO it's a good thing to cut back on this as like you said it doesn't fit the design for that style of game.\\n\\n\\nThese are really just action games, the skilled, planned assassination identity was gone after AC2, now you just run and stab and shoot.\\u00a0 And when your design philosophy has both coined a term with a massive negative connotation (Ubisoft Towers) and become exceedingly unfun for players, it's a good thing to move on instead of trying to force it back in.\\n\\n\\nIf the identity of your games has become \\\"collect a billion repetitive map markers\\\" to the point the industry collectively groans when they see an open world map, it's an identity that needs to be reimagined to keep players engaged. || Imo 3 was the worst one\\n\\nI know a lot of people liked it but the setting made the whole rooftop stealth stuff that was so fun in the Ezio games completely disappear cause it was completely open between places.\\n\\nI\\u2019ve played all of them except Mirage and 3 is my least favourite \\n\\nValhalla doesn\\u2019t feel like an AC game but if you play it as if it isn\\u2019t then it is quite fun. You really need to commit to being a Viking and opting for big battles rather than forcing assassins stealth stuff which makes no sense in the universe || I actually hate the new RPG formula. My problems with the franchise were weak stories and poor mission design, but I felt the core gameplay was fine. || [deleted] || The team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown are supposedly working on another Rayman, though there's nothing concrete yet. || Far Cry 2 was a sleeper game that could have been great if it weren't for the insanely short respawn timers for enemy bases. Like you could park up, clear out a checkpoint, go back to your car and drive through and the enemies would have respawned, it was wild. Made traversing the map a nightmare, which was a shame because the whole point was the open world. || Thing is Ubisoft have shown that they can write compelling villains in the past. Vass, Pagan Min, Haytham Kenway etc. but they just aren\\u2019t anywhere near consistent enough with it. || I'm not gonna praise it per se but at least every side-thing in Elden Ring had a reward. Be it a spell, an upgrade, a weapon... and since none are marked in the map I never had the urge to do them. I'd just walk around, see something curious in the distance and go check. || > You'll not find a copy pasted lava chariot dungeon anywhere else\\u00a0\\n\\nI want to say there's like 2 or 3 chariot dungeons actually. They're maybe a bit different in overall implementation but similar enough I couldn't actually tell you which was which. They blend together with time. || Well said. Just a little bit of integrating things with the world makes it feel better, even if it's fundamentally the same gameplay. Most quests in games boil down to \\\"Defeat # of X things\\\" but if you dress it up nice to the player, it's plenty palatable. \\n\\nI enjoy examples of quest descriptions in Monster Hunter games, even if most people don't read them. You get quests that range from \\\"Monster is causing havoc and mayhem on this road please help\\\" to \\\"This monster looked at my wife funny go kill it\\\" to \\\"The guildmarm really, really likes this punchy monster in a weird way please help research it\\\" || I have a theory Cassandra was the more engaging main character. Seems more that played her liked the game. || Yeah that was my problem with everything after origins, they just added too much bloat and I got bored of it. || >I've not explored much of it\\n\\nMan, you haven't even gotten to the normal good parts, not to mention all the cool dlc stuff.\\n\\n>And the map is way too big.\\n\\nYou don't need to explore everything, and remember that half the map is just water. \\n\\nJust set the game to easy, work on the big story stuff, explore what interests you, and you'll be happy you pushed through when you can run around with magical powers steamrolling everything in Ng+ || There are some very fun surprises you can accidentally stumble upon (some that play a major part of the story), if you know your Greek mythology and where to look\\u2026 || Odyssey is a bloated mess, idk how it escapes the criticisms Valhalla gets || Yes, your Basim theory is correct. But it was indeed confusing and poorly explained, had to look it up online myself || Yes, your Basim theory is correct. But it was indeed confusing and poorly explained, had to look it up online myself || They are \\\"sages\\\" which were introduced around Black Flag. (I honestly didn't really understood it at that time)\\n\\n\\nIn short: Several ISU (like Odin and Loki) put their memories into the DNA of human\\u00a0and then many years later in some human these memories emerge and might take over\\u00a0or merge with the mind of the person.\\n\\n\\nIn Valhalla you see Evoir resisting it and in the end also avoiding Odin. Basim on the other hand merged with Loki (before the events of Valhalla). But Loki wasn't sure Evoir was really Odin until the end. The Asgard quests explains Loki's hatred towards Odin (Loki had an affair and 3 illegitimate children of which one, Fenrir, was imprisoned by Odin). || Actually the Black Flag team(Montreal) developed Origins. And the Syndicate team(Quebec) was behind Odyssey. || I'm a big fan of both base settings but I liked Odyssey a bit more too. I think at least part of it is Origins isn't really \\\"ancient\\\" Egypt it's Ptolemaic Egypt, so Roman era Egypt essentially. Definitely an interesting historical time period but not quite the level of ancient vibes. || Thank you. I've said for years FromSoft gets a pass on things that from just about any other gaming company fans would (rightly) criticize them about. || It launched with unfinished quests. || Shit quest system, shit storytelling, very little reason to actually explore other than find bosses. But good fighting and beautiful world. \\n\\nIt has its pluses but unless you really enjoy the fighting just wandering around it was a super mid game. || * Opens youtube\\n* Search for Elden ring quest guides\\n* Videos with views like 8 million, 5 million, 4.2 million appear\\n* Organic quest design at its finest\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nI should have dropped some guide videos back in 2022 when the game launched, would have earned thousands of bucks\\u00a0 || There's a line between mysterious and obtuse though and I think sometimes FromSoft games lean a little too close to the latter. I have a whole rant on how the genre has issues that the fandom would not let slide from any other type of game but gets a pass; but that's for another thread. || After some time with the DLC, I'm glad the gaming public is finally starting to realize some of the things about FromSoft's design really aren't the greatest and it's time they smoothed certain things over. You can still be \\\"Dark Souls hard\\\" and not screw over the player with random bad luck. || Me when i spread misinformation:\\n\\nMiquella's rune breaking doesnt end any questline, it just starts all the quests. The only way to lock yourself out of quests is if you go to the last dungeon of the dlc without interacting with any npcs. || If they wanted to keep it organic without map markers, they could've included something like Morrowind's journal system, where it tells you what you did and where to look next for more information. || Ah yeah, that's next to the old Arkznclugbflelzth. || Not a bad thing at all, I much prefer it to Skyrim's point and click quest markers and fast travel system. Adds to the adventuring || Modern AC games are some of the best (modern) games when it comes to giving you directions that you don't need quest markers for || Morrowind had some quests like that as well. I remember one quest where it was like \\\"You'll find the guy in a cave northwest of Ald'ruhn.\\\" Northwest of Ald'ruhn is a big area, almost a quarter of the entire map. I searched for ages and found nothing before I looked it up. Turns out what they meant is \\\"north-north-north-northwest, and then as far as you can go before hitting the coast\\\". || Never said it wasn't.  Just hoping it is in AC Shadows.  I guess we can expect even the most basic filtering capability but wouldn't claim to know for sure.  It's the nothing at all option I'd be particularly fond of.\\n\\nI haven't played any of the AC games in quite a while so I don't really remember how extensive the filtering on the maps is. || I think we've seen very different gameplay...\\nCheck out some of the recently released gameplay. Everything looks way more polished and cleaner || That does help, though sifting through the lies is far from simple. I\\u2019ve never gotten the hang of getting any truth out of reviews at all. || That's how Witcher 3 did it too. Well it has a question mark to say *something* is there, but you have to get close to know what it is. || This is why I stopped listening to players complaining about games. A lot of times, they describe things they hate in games and then low and behold the games they love do the same thing but it's fine because its \\\"different\\\" lmfao || Ghost of Tsushima was utilizing the wind to direct players to new objectives, which is a very immersive way to do it. You can even be guided by the direction of the floating particles. That way you could move from one objective to the next without opening the map. \\n\\nNot a perfect system, but far preferable. || GoT was a tight map though with not a lot of empty space. In Valhalla and Mirage there was a ton of area where there was literally nothing there. Not to mention GoT used other ways to get the players attention to draw you to its activities like sign posts and foxes. Which again AC has only used map markers.\\n\\nSo I'm not too thrilled that there's every chance I'll just be wasting my time exploring certain areas. || Not really. No mini map and no symbols on your screen outside of the map. If something was near you a golden bird appeared and led you there and marked waypoints and story objectives were hinted at through a wind you could activate. Fells much more natural than a mini map with 20 question marks and other symbols. || Tbh, ghost of Tsushima was beautiful but in terms of an open world gameplay loop I felt it was really far behind an AC game probably as far back as AC 3. || [removed] || I appreciate how in God Of War, someone in the party will literally say \\u201clooks like you don\\u2019t have the right tools for this yet\\u201d which is soooo handy. || AC3 had the worst designed cities. Too much open space.\\n\\nAC4 which ran on the same engine had very fun cities. Havanna is one of my favourites in all of the games. || Valhalla as a Viking game was fantastic tbh. Play it without giving a shit about stealth and it\\u2019s a great time || Not really, it's based on the dev blog and leaves out most of everything\\n\\n[https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt) || Yeah that killed it. It was fun to fuck around in but for actually getting shit done, it made traversal a chore. || Makes some of em sound better than they were. Ghostwort was the reward a lot of the time. Or a recipe book in the expansion.\\n\\n>and since none are marked in the map I never had the urge to do them. I'd just walk around, see something curious in the distance and go check\\n\\nThat's fine and all but at the same time very crucial things were hidden among the so-so rewards. Namely the bells that would let you buy upgrade materials. Actually finding those organically would require throwing yourself at every side cave you found. || I read that Cassandra was supposed to be the only main character but management didnt like it so they had to add the male option || Definitely my preferred main character.\\n\\nThe fact she was the one they used for AC: Nexus points toward what you said being true. || I have played through as both Cassandra and Alexios, and thought the game was far more fulfilling as Cassandra. || Yeah, the only explanation I could come up with as to why the ending happened like that was because >!Basim/Loki was avenging his son Fenrir by killing Eivor/Odin. But the fact that *Eivor* was confused too just left me at skeptical instead of absolutely sure.!< || I'm aware of Black Flag's sage, but I had no idea this stuff with Basim and Eivor was *also* sage stuff. So Valhalla was to imply *multiple* sage lineages? Because yeah, Basim didn't really look like the sage in AC4, and the temple in that game provided the fact that sages retain their face throughout every lifetime. (Though with that detail I should've connected the same fact for Eivor and Basim. Bah, that one's on me lol)\\n\\nThough that does raise interesting questions then. Is a sage lineage how Abstergo managed to create the Animus in the first place? Studying a sage, follow the same \\\"ancestral link\\\" and replicate it for non-sage ancestries like Desmond Miles' ancestor, Ezio? || Tiollier Dragon Priestess route and Moores quests are both permanently broken by the Miquella Rune Break event if you don't know exactly how to work around it which you only have 1 chance at anyways. This essentially means that anyone going through blind has a very high risk of breaking multiple different characters quest-lines just by walking into the wrong spot. You can also lose access to all 6 pest cookbook missions depending on how you end up reacting with Moore and how far you were though them.\\n\\nThen you later on can permanently break parts of Hornsent and Leda's Questlines by walking into a boss room NOT EVEN DEFEATING IT JUST ENTERING. || Fast travel systems arent a problem, you can just not use them. Its good that they exist for players with less time and patience || Its a bit annoying tho, because it can be something boring. I remember going mark by mark when I started the game and giving up shortly || I feel like GoT had a lot less mundane shit than say Valhalla. If Shadows still has the raw quantity of boring whatever through the map it doesn't matter how it's discovered. And arguably GoT was way better written than some of recent Assassin's Creed games as well... people will forgive say 100 boring chests around Skellige if the plot of the game itself is good/engrossing (The Witcher 3). || Well you are wrong. GoT didn't do that. || Ghost was a boring slog of an open world with great combat. You aren't wrong. \\n\\nJust remember: Sony makes games for people who don't like playing games. || Cope harder. How about you play a game before saying shit that's wrong || True. I either want to be immediately notified that I cannot access something or be given the ability to access everything in any order. || I haven't played the older GoWs but the 2018 one (I really disliked it) treats players like morons tbh, this, the constant tips of Mimir on your hip after spending total time of 0.4 nanosecond on puzzle, I wouldn't be surprised if they added a tool to just let the game play by itself || Which is kinda a problem of the setting. Making early new York or Boston a tight knit crowded city where you possibly jump between buildings would be to make them look entirely unlike what they really looked like. Early NA colonies has more space than they knew what to do with Ave really spread out with mostly low buildings. \\n\\nGranted, they don't always make things look historically accurate. Valhalla looked entirely unlike what early medieval England looked like for example. To a really annoying degree for someone like myself who loves that time period and was looking forward to it. Stone everywhere. Castles churches, everything in stone. 970 AD almost everything was made of wood, I hated it. They also had all the soldiers in plate. Ridiculous. At that time you were rich if you could get chainmail. || It's also their most ahistorical looking game imo. Stone and plate armor everywhere. It's supposed to be 950 ad for pitys sake. || And who do you think is the DEV blog written by? || \\\"Ubisoft provided the info\\\"  \\n\\\"No they didn't. Here look at this [www.ubisoft.com](http://www.ubisoft.com) link.\\\"\\n\\nBruh, are you serious? || People on Reddit really struggle with critical thinking, don't they? || Malaka! || How... frustrating. || There's a little of that but also I think >!Basim/Loki was realizing Eivor is nearly at a point of fully awakening the Odin side and then she'd be an actual tangible threat to his current goals!< || Again, not disagreeing, just stating what I prefer. || That's the point of exploration though no? Sometimes you get something boring, sometimes you get something exciting, but the point is to explore to find out what it is. If you already know what it's going to be, why explore anything? Just head straight to what you want and ignore everything else. || That\\u2019s life my man. || Valhalla definitely had more mundane shit but GoT is still filled with it. Recently replayed it to get platinum and I started to hate the game because of the repetitive, boring side content, especially those stupid fucking foxes. || bruh GoT has ALOT of mundane shit, that's coming from a guy that 100% the map.\\n\\nboth my friends who play GoT at the same time stopped doing them and went straight through the story, while i stuck with it.\\n\\nso many usseles rewards aswell || Damn, I never heard better descriptor for modern sony exclusives, but I think You may be right lol || Look, I never said it was all that historically accurate. I just said it was fun lol || Not really. I liked W3 overall, but the map design was a pretty big drawback for me. Why not have fewer - but more impactful discoveries? It feels shitty (and goes against the intended level curve) not to work through any questionsmarks at all, but doing them felt like working off of some checklist instead of exploring the world. || I dont want to know whats going to be, but I do want to know if its something interesting. I liked the way Valhalla did it, I just plain skipped what I already knew wasnt worth my time and was meant for the completionists.\\n\\nI missed really cool stuff about the question markers in Witcher 3 because I got totally bored of chasing them. || Yeah I dont play games to be reminded how boring and disappointing life can be, I would prefer to have fun if you dont mind || I'm certainly not saying the filler content was good. Honestly it's bad across the entire open world genre. They've all got mind-numbing mundane shit crammed in and achieves, upgrades, or resources locked behind said mundane copypaste. \\n\\nJust few things are quite on Ubisoft's level in that regard. GoT isn't gonna take nearly as much time to plat as a number of open worlds. || I didn't say it didn't have mundane shit, it doesn't hold a candle to recent Ubi games in that regard though. Did you play Valhalla? The maps keep getting bigger and there's more and more \\\"?\\\" but less and less of actual interest. And it's not like the plot and side-quests were good enough to carry it. || Sony makes game for people who want to star in movies, not play games.\\n\\nI'm not judging. Just saying. || Fair, lol. I'm just one one about it, little salty. It's one of my favorite periods of history || But that's interesting or not depends on the person. I loved Gwent but wasn't a fan of monster nests. A friend of mine loved the nests but hated Gwent || I don't know, if I always know something is going to be interesting, then it's no longer interesting and the rest of the game becomes boring. It works in some games where there is no exploration involved, but if there's going to be, an air of mystery adds to that mechanic. || could say the same with GoT nearly every side quest started with following a npc then killing a group of enemies.\\n\\nand there were ALOT OF EM.\\n\\nanother reason why my friends rushed through the story, cause the sidequests ended up really repetitive || I dont agree. If something could be interesting but then its not, its just disappointing and I dont play games to be bored and disappointed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
